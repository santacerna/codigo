Notably, mental health problems can significantly reduce student performance in school, including both engagement and achievement. Both mental health problems and reduced student performance often arise due to peer victimization, which can include teasing, racial- or gender-based discrimination, and/or physical assault. Stress has been proposed as one mechanism through which victimization influences mental health, and stress can also interfere with academic performance at school, including engagement and achievement. To date, however, no research has evaluated longitudinal associations between victimization and stress, and how these longitudinal patterns may impact adolescent behavior and mental health. In this study, we used data from a 2-year cluster randomized trial of cooperative learning to evaluate an etiological process model that includes (1) longitudinal reciprocal effects between victimization and stress, and (2) the effects of both victimization and stress on student mental health and academic engagement. We hypothesized that victimization and stress would have significant reciprocal effects, and that both would predict greater mental health problems and lower academic engagement. We further hypothesized that cooperative learning would have significant effects on all constructs. We found partial support for this model, whereby stress predicted greater victimization, but victimization did not predict increased stress. While both factors were linked to student outcomes, stress was a more powerful predictor. We also found significant salutary effects of cooperative learning on all constructs. The implications of these results for student behavioral and mental health are discussed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

The transition to university life can be demanding, leading to mental health disorders. Persistent stress and anxiety can cause demotivation, difficulties with concentration, cognitive impairment, and reduced academic performance. Mental health issues can also impact social relationships and overall well-being. This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the mental health of medical students and compare it with the mental health of the non-student population. Materials and Methods: The survey collected demographic information such as age and gender. Participants were questioned about their self-perceived mental distress, diagnosed mental disorders, and history of therapy for mental distress. Various validated assessment tools were utilized to assess mental health and quality of life. Results: Medical students exhibit a higher self-perception of mental symptoms that does not translate into a significantly higher prevalence of diagnosed mental disorders. Medical students experience higher levels of anxiety and subclinical depressive symptoms and lower quality of life. Female participants reported lower QoL scores and higher levels of anxiety symptoms compared with male participants. While the prevalence of mental disorders did not differ significantly between genders (except for clinical anxiety), females tended to perceive a higher burden of mental health challenges. Conclusions: By addressing mental health issues among medical students, especially females, institutions can create a more supportive and conducive learning environment. Encouraging open conversations about mental health and providing accessible mental health services can help in destigmatizing mental health challenges and promoting early intervention when needed. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

These disorders impair emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning, such as unsatisfying peer relationships, disruptive behavior, and decreased academic performance. They also contribute to vulnerability in later adulthood which negatively influences life-long well-being. Thus, research into etiology is imperative to provide implications for prevention and intervention within family and school practices. It is suggested that the onset of psychological disorders, such as depression and anxiety, is closely related to stress levels and patterns of stress reaction. Therefore, considerable research has investigated the link between hereditary factors, economic status, dispositional vulnerability, social relationships, and stress levels. The current study examines existing evidence and identifies multifaceted risk factors for adolescents’ mental problems across three layers, including individual traits and personality, family status and practices, as well as peer relationships, and school climate. It is also suggested that factors from these three perspectives interact and are closely interconnected, directly or indirectly contributing to adolescent psychopathology. The implications for future development of prevention and intervention programs, as well as therapy, are discussed. © 2024 by the authors.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

To slow down spread of pandemic, measures like social distancing, online education, lockdowns, etc were taken. Adolescents and young adults had decreased communication with peers and extended families. Their screen time including videogaming also increased due to virtual learning. This study was undertaken to assess and compare the screen-time, mental health, physical activities, sleep etc of adolescents when physical schools are closed for long durations among different age groups of adolescents and between males and females. This study was conducted on 78 adolescents aged 10-17 years who were attending the Paediatric Outpatient Department of a Government Hospital. It was conducted over 3 months during a period of compulsory online classes. However, there was no lockdown during this period. It was found that boys had increased physical activity duration in comparison to pre pandemic times (P-value 0.03509). The duration of playing videogames had significantly increased too for boys. Adolescents more than 13 years ie, in mid adolescence had higher screen time and more incidence of mood disturbances, depression or anxiety than the younger ones. However, there was no significant increase of stress factors due to their stay at home, or online education. Screen time and stress were significant factors for developing psychological changes among students. Most adolescents knew that watching screen excessively is bad though few tried to decrease screen-time. Duration of physical activity among students was not a significant factor for obesity or being overweight among students although, increase in sleeping time was significant factor. Most students’ academic performance remained same or became better as reported by themselves. Most Adolescents have knowledge but need guidance and constant support for inculcating health promoting activities and habits like pursuing hobbies, exercise during periods of deviation from routine life. © 2024 Evangel Publishing.

These include academic overload and completion of assignments and exams, exacerbated by such external conditions as family, social and economic problems. Together, these can affect emotional and physical health, which may lead in the long term to developing a number of pathologies, given the alteration of immunological homoeostasis with which they are related. Objective: To evaluate the effect of academic stress on the production of cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 in Morphology students in the Faculty of Health Sciences of the Universidad del Cauca during an academic period. Methodology: A descriptive longitudinal study was carried out with a population of 78 students studying Morphology, among the subjects with the highest academic load in the Physiotherapy, Medicine, Nursing and Phonoaudiology programs in the Faculty. Academic stress was assessed in the students by applying the Academic Stress Questionnaire (ASQ), and through quantification of the IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 cytokines using the ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) technique in three “moments” of the academic semester: Moment 1: beginning of the academic semester; Moment 2: week of evaluations of 70% of the semester; Moment 3: week of final exams. Results: The students perceived stress as “normal” at Moment 1, while at Moments 2 and 3 it was perceived as ""quite a lot"", with percentages of 48.7% and 50%, respectively. The predominant stressors were: “methodological deficiencies”, “academic overload”, and “exams”, for the three moments of the study. “Physical exhaustion” was the most prevalent stress response at all three moments, followed by “irascible behaviour” (Moment 2 and 3), and “sleep disturbances” (Moment 3). To cope with the stress, the students resorted mainly to ""planning and management of personal resources"" in the three moments of the study. A progressive increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α and a decrease in IL-10 were observed at all three moments. A correlation was found between some questions belonging to the ""methodological deficiencies"", ""beliefs about performance"", ""sleep disturbances"", ""physical exhaustion"" and ""irascible behaviour"" dimensions with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL. −10. Conclusion: The morphology students suffer increased stress indicators (perceived stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines) throughout the academic period. The “methodological deficiencies”, “academic overload” and “exams” stressors, together with “physical exhaustion”, “sleep disturbances” and “irascible behaviour”, possibly influence the production of the IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10 cytokines. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Housemaids are the most vulnerable group to sexual violence due to their nature of work. It leads to various physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health problems, especially in our country's context. However, they have limited information regarding the magnitude and the factors associated with sexual violence among housemaids. As a result, the purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude and risk factors for sexual violence among female housemaids attending night school in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia, in 2022. Method An institution-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 340 housemaids attending night school in Bahir Dar city from May 15 to June 20, 2022. Participants were selected using simple random sampling through computer-generated techniques. An interviewer- administered, structured questionnaire was used. Data were entered, coded, and cleaned using EPI Data version 4.6.0.2, and exported to SPSS version 26 for further analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were done to identify factors associated with sexual violence. P-value and 95% confidence interval were used to declare the statistical association. Result The magnitude of sexual violence after being a housemaid was 30.3% with a 95% confidence interval (25.3-35.38). Ever had sex [Adjusted Odds Ratio(AOR) = 4.67; 95%; Confidence Interval(CI) (2.60, 8.39)], no discussion of sexual and reproductive issues [Adjusted Odds Ratio(AOR) = 2.32; 95%; Confidence Interval(CI) (1.29, 4.16)], poor social support [Adjusted Odds Ratio(AOR) = 2.69; 95%; Confidence Interval(CI) (1.32, 5.52)], were identified as factors associated with sexual violence among housemaids. Similarly, academic performance [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.96; 95%; Confidence Interval (CI) (0.93, 0.99)], and distance to reach school [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.04; 95%; Confidence Interval (CI) (1.19, 3.48)] were identified as factors associated with sexual violence among housemaids. Conclusion This study identified that the magnitude of sexual violence among housemaids was high. Housemaids who ever had sex, no discussion of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) with anyone, poor social support, poor academic performance, and distance to reach school were factors associated with sexual violence. Therefore, creating a sexual and reproductive health (SRH) discussion session for housemaids is important for securing their sexual rights.  © 2024 Gebremariam et al.

Stress is a major public health issue that can impact both physical and mental well-being. It is prevalent in many areas of modern life, including education. Healthcare students are at a high risk of experiencing stress due to the unique demands of their fields of study. Study design and methods. An online survey was conducted on 2,515 undergraduate students pursuing degrees in medicine, preventive medicine, pharmacy, and nursing at Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Can Tho City, Vietnam. Results. Using the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), it was found that 35.2% of students reported mild stress, 62.7% had moderate stress, and only 2.1% experienced severe stress. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed nine significant factors associated with students’ stress levels (p ≤ 0.05). Particularly, medicine students exhibited a significantly higher level of moderate and severe stress (95% CI = 1.22-2.01), 1.57 times higher than preventive medicine students. Sixth-year students had a stress level 1.58 times higher (95% CI = 1.11-2.26) than first-year students. Students achieving excellent and very good academic performances in the last semester had a stress level 1.60 times higher (95% CI = 1.16-2.22) than students with average and lower academic performance. Students living at home had a stress level 1.73 times higher (95% CI = 1.05-2.84) than students living in their relatives’ houses. Students who rarely or never had a part-time job during academic years had a stress level 1.70 times higher (95% CI = 1.31-2.20) than those who often or sometimes had a part-time job. Students with a family history of smoking addiction had a stress level 1.69 times higher (95% CI = 1.28-2.22) than students without such a family history. Students who rarely or never received concern and sharing from family had a stress level 7.41 times higher (95% CI = 5.07-10.84) than students who often or sometimes received concern and sharing from family. Students who were often or sometimes cursed by family had a stress level 2.04 times higher (95% CI = 1.09-3.81) than students who were rarely or never cursed by family. Students without close friends had a stress level 1.46 times higher (95% CI = 1.11-1.91) than students with close friends. Conclusions. The rates of mild and moderate stress levels were significantly higher than severe stress level among healthcare students. Research has provided scientific findings as the basis for determining risk factors and imposing solutions that aim to reduce the rate of stress in students.

Due to its relationship with positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction, mental health, job performance or SES, academic achievement is a significant phenomenon that impacts students, families, and educational institutions. The present study sought to contribute to the field by reviewing the literature on the determinants that influence the objective achievements of a typical population of middle- to high-school students. Based on the PRISMA statement, a search for related studies was performed in the WoS, EBSCO, and PubMed databases, and 771 studies published between 1930 and 2022 were identified. After screening based on the analysis of abstracts, 35 studies met the selection criteria. The Bronfenbrenner ecological model served as the theoretical rationale for organizing the studies’ findings. The results of this review highlight the following determinants of school achievement: (i) Personal factors—gender, personality traits, cognitive abilities and academic background, motivation and self-constructs, stress and problem-solving strategies, and substance use; (ii) Contextual microsystem factors—(a) Family—parental educational background; parenting practices and interactions; parental involvement and support; (b) School—school location; school conditions, responsiveness, and practices; (c) Peers—peer-group disagreement management. This systematic review updates the existing empirical evidence on this topic and highlights the complexity of the phenomenon of academic achievement. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms and its associated factors among adolescents from urban Nepal. The depressive symptoms among 271 randomly selected secondary school adolescents of Britamod Municipality were assessed using Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression were executed to assess the statistical relationship between potential risk factors and depressive symptoms at 5% level of significance. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 42.8% (95% CI: 37.3–49.1%). Multiple logistic regression revealed that female adolescents (aOR: 2.309, 95% CI: 1.233–4.325), adolescents enrolled in higher grades i.e. 10th grade (aOR: 4.576, 95% CI: 1.482–9.128), studying at private school (aOR: 2.302, 95% CI: 1.184–4.476), not sharing their problems with their friends (aOR: 3.022, 95% CI: 1.477–6.186), presence of perceived academic stress (aOR: 2.388, 95% CI: 1.263–4.518), dissatisfaction with current academic performance (aOR: 2.278, 95% CI: 1.141–4.518), lower perceived family support (aOR: 3.440, 95% CI: 1.276–9.275), and lower self-esteem (aOR: 2.139, 95% CI: 1.061–8.708) had higher odds of experiencing depressive symptoms. There is a high prevalence of depression among Nepalese adolescents. The findings highlight the need for health promotion interventions focusing on mental health awareness, enhancing social support systems, and implementing stress reduction strategies within schools to mitigate the burden of depression among Nepalese adolescents.

Over half of college students in the U.S. report a mental health issue, with 60% reporting one at the two-year mark. Even when aware of such mental health issues, students are still hesitant to seek treatment. As such, investigating perceptions of mental health time off may illuminate perceived usefulness of such policies as well as potential processes for defining and implementing such policies. This study sought to answer the question, “What are the perspectives of time-off for mental health?” Using Reddit’s responses, this study extracted (N = 392) quotes and used thematic analysis to identify four main themes. Implications include the need for school-level mental health time-off policies or integration of instructors’ policies into their syllabi for transparency to students, which may alleviate student stress and further stigmatization. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Based on multiple studies, medical education is known for its rigorous curricula, continuous high academic demands, frequent assessments, practical instruction, and mentorship, all of which contribute to a stressful atmosphere that results in elevated rates of depression, anxiety during exams, subpar academic achievement, and a higher number of medical student dropouts. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of test anxiety and predisposing factors among students at Unaizah College of Medicine. Results: Our study revealed that 45.4% of responders reported having low anxiety, while 33.2% of them reported having moderate anxiety. A lower but statistically significant percentage (21.5%) expressed high levels of anxiety. Regarding the factors contributing to exam anxiety in medical students such as social support, it was found that the students with poor social support exhibited significant odds of severe test anxiety. Remarkably, there was a decreased likelihood of experiencing severe anxiety when studying all the night before the exam. Conclusion: Research results have the potential to impact institutional policies concerning medical students’ well-being. Colleges can create supportive environments that address the factors causing test anxiety and promote mental health and academic success. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

There is a need for interventions that can reach students at scale, and therefore this study aimed to estimate the effects of a single session low-threshold digital intervention (Focus) for procrastination behaviors among university students in Sweden. Methods and analysis: A two-arm, parallel groups (1:1), single blind randomized controlled trial was conducted between February 8 to April 26, 2023. The study used email to invite university students across Sweden to participate in the trial. Both the intervention and the control group were invited to assess their current procrastination behaviors using the Pure Procrastination Scale (PPS). The intervention group immediately received feedback and behavior change advice by means of an interactive website, while the control group was shown their total PPS score without any further feedback. Students were included in the study if they scored 20 points or more on the PPS. Our primary outcome was procrastination behavior measured at 2 months post-randomization. Analyses were conducted using multilevel regression models estimated with Bayesian inference. Results: A total of 2209 participants (intervention: 1109, control: 1100) were randomized. The average age of participants was 26.4 years (SD = 7.8) and 65 % were women (n = 1442). The mean PPS score at baseline was 35.6 points (of a maximum of 60). Primary outcome data were available for 45 % (n = 498) of the intervention group and 55 % (n = 601) of the control group. The evidence suggested no marked difference between groups regarding any of the outcomes, although there was weak evidence of lower physical activity in the intervention group. Qualitative findings from open-ended responses uncovered a variety of views on procrastination and perceived problems that may follow. Those not feeling supported by Focus explained having troubles adopting the advice given and converting their intentions into action without more continuous support. Conclusions: Access to a single session of feedback and behavior change advice by means of an interactive website did not produce differential self-reported procrastination among university students who took the opportunity to self-assess their behaviors. The findings are limited by assessment reactivity due to screening at baseline and attrition to follow-up. © 2024 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This causes changes to the adaptation process among adolescents including moral rehabilitation programs. Cases of drug abuse among adolescents, which are increasing day by day, require an effective moral rehabilitation program for the group to recover from the problem. Addressing drug use among adolescents is a significant concern, as it can have detrimental effects on their physical and mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being. Adolescents may experiment with drugs for various reasons, including curiosity, peer pressure, coping with stress, or seeking a sense of belonging. This study was carried out to look at the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program with a religious and spiritual concept offered at Tunas Bakti School Teluk Air Tawar, Penang as an effort to rehabilitate adolescents involved in drug abuse and to see the acceptance of the youth towards the moral rehabilitation program with a religious and spiritual concept. Data for this study has been collected using questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Quantitative data obtained from the questionnaire was analysed using the SPSS software. Based on this analysis, the effectiveness of the moral rehabilitation program is high and has a strong relationship with the youth's acceptance of the rehabilitation program carried out.

In the past 3 decades, a multitude of pharmacological, stimulation, and exercise-based interventions have been proposed to ameliorate symptoms, memory impairment, mental fatigue, and/or sleep disturbances. However, most research is preliminary, thus limited influence on clinical practice. This review aims to systematically appraise the evidence derived from randomized controlled trials (RCT) regarding the effectiveness of pharmacological, stimulation, and exercise-based interventions in treating chronic symptoms due to TBI. Our search results indicate that despite the largest volume of literature, pharmacological interventions, especially using neurostimulant medications to treat physical, cognitive, and mental fatigue, as well as daytime sleepiness, have yielded inconsistent results, such that some studies found improvements in fatigue (e.g., Modafinil, Armodafinil) while others failed to yield the improvements after the intervention. Conversely, brain stimulation techniques (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, blue light therapy) and exercise interventions were effective in ameliorating mental health symptoms and cognition. However, given that most RCTs are equipped with small sample sizes, more high-quality, larger-scale RCTs is needed.

It is crucial to identify and examine students’ stress levels as it offers insights into their well-being academic performance and excellence of life. The goal of this study is to develop a mental stress detection system that utilizes a combination of multiple sensor’s data fusion and deep machine learning (ML) models with the help of three physiological signals named electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR) and skin temperature (ST). Data is gathered from 200 students with the help of some stressors using a novel Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) device developed using low-cost sensors. Then the data went through pre-processed methods before being analyzed using some techniques of deep ML models like multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to identify stress. The results show that the RNN and LSTM models regularly outperform the MLPNN model in recognizing mental stress. These models adequately depicted the dynamic character of stress reactions while efficiently capturing temporal dependencies. The accuracy of the RNN and LSTM models was 92.34% and 93.20%, respectively. These models’ improved performance demonstrates their potential in stress detection applications. The combination of multi-sensor data fusion with deep ML algorithms allows for the precise detection of stress-related physiological changes. This has major consequences for student well-being and academic success since it enables personalized stress management tactics and interventions. Student’s mental health and academic experience can be improved by proactive efforts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Perceived stress has been linked to higher levels of depression among healthcare students. This study set out to assess EI, perceived stress (PS), and life quality assessment (LQA) among dental undergraduates and to ascertain how these factors are linked to one another. Materials and Methods: The self-reported cross-sectional research was organized among preclinical and clinical years of dental students to examine their emotional intelligence and stress-coping capacity. About 146 students participated in the study, with ages ranging from 19 to 25, irrespective of gender. The students were given the Schutte Emotional Intelligence and Perceived Stress Scale tools (PSS10) by Cohen, and with World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) tool examined the characteristics that contribute to life quality among students. Results: The study included 146 individuals, 38 males (26.02%) and 108 females (73.97%), with an unresponsiveness rate of 2.66%. The correlation revealed statistically high significance among emotional intelligence and perceived stress (P = 0.000), perceived stress and life quality (P = 0.02), and emotional intelligence and life quality (P = 0.008). The statistical analysis of the influence of EI, PS, and LQA on academic year-wise analysis determined non-significant (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Due to the time constraints of their job, dentistry training may be highly stressful, yet regular evaluations of student performance and the accompanying factors would help us to understand how students behave in challenging circumstances. © 2024 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This can result in decreased academic performance, poor retention, and burnout. Interventions to help students cope are therefore a critical need for academic institutions. The current study sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of a brief multimodal intervention in reducing student distress. Method: The study was a randomised controlled design that evaluated a brief intervention of cognitive-behavioural therapy, mindfulness, and healthy lifestyle choices. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 was administered to participants at baseline and two post-intervention time points. Control participants did not participate in any intervention. Participants were recruited from graduate students in first-year classes within the School of Health Professions at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Results: Analysis revealed an overall mild to moderate decline in Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 total scores over three assessment periods for both treatment and control groups, with no statistical differences noted between groups; however, the treatment group's scores declined approximately 6 weeks before the control participants' scores declined. Conclusion: The pattern of change in the two groups suggests that our intervention facilitated the reduction in student anxiety more quickly than would have occurred normally and with sustained results. © 2023 The Authors.

Despite their ubiquity during the early pandemic, knowledge on the developmental impacts of pandemic-related financial hardships on adolescents’ adjustment is lacking. Guided by family stress and life course perspectives, this study investigated direct and indirect relations between pandemic-related financial hardships and adolescents’ later depressive symptoms, delinquency, and academic performance via parents’ depressive symptoms and acceptance. Data were drawn from three waves of a longitudinal study; participants completed online surveys at Wave 1, COVID-19 Wave (seven months later) and Wave 2 (five months later). Participants were two adolescent-aged siblings (n = 1364; 50% female; Mage = 14.45, SD = 1.55 years) and one parent (n = 682; 85% female; Mage = 45.15, SD = 5.37 years) from 682 families (N = 2048). Structural equation modeling results indicated that pandemic-related financial hardships were indirectly linked to greater adolescent delinquency and lower academic performance by adversely shaping parents’ mental health and parent-adolescent relationship quality. The findings highlight financial hardships as critical family stressors for adolescent adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Despite its widespread impact, a notable gap remains in the literature, particularly in reference to the literature concerning university students. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of food insecurity and examine its associated factors, including mental and general health and academic performance, among university students in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A total of 421 students from King Abdulaziz University participated in this study, completing a questionnaire that measured food insecurity, academic performance, and mental and general health. About 40% of the respondents experienced some level of food insecurity, which was categorized as mild (20.4%), moderate (13.0%), or severe (5.6%). Significant associations were observed between food insecurity and monthly household income (p < 0.001) and general health (p < 0.005), respectively. However, the associations were weaker between food insecurity and perceived stress (p < 0.066) and the impact of COVID-19. Notably, no significant correlation was found between food security and socio-demographic characteristics or academic performance. This study highlights the prevalence of food insecurity among university students in Saudi Arabia and emphasizes the need for further research to gain a better understanding of its complexities. Such insights can empower universities and policymakers to implement targeted interventions, thereby enhancing the learning experience and future success of university students. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The study therefore assessed the efficacy of mindfulness intervention in addressing workplace stress among adult education lecturers in Nigeria. Methods: Following a mixed-methods approach, pre-post-test and follow-up survey data, snowballing and purposive sampling techniques were used to recruit 365 lecturers for the survey (Phase 1) and 26 lecturers for the controlled experiment (Phase 2). The study variables were measured with psychometrically robust scales: Daily Stressor Scale and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Results: Overall, 248 (67.9%) male lecturers and 117 (32.1%) female lecturers participated in the study, with ages ranging from 34 to 65 years with an average age of 47.13 (SD = 8.54). We found 56.7% prevalence of workplace stress and mindfulness levels significantly and inversely correlated with workplace stress. Further, introducing or exposing lecturers to modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (mMBSR) significantly reduced workplace stress, whereas the control group showed no significant reduction in workplace stress. Conclusion: The conclusion was reached that mMBSR demonstrated its clinical importance and usefulness in mitigating workplace stress prevalent among lecturers. The study findings indicate the importance of enhancing lecturers' awareness for the need of positive coping and adjustment, as well as becoming more emotionaly and socialy adept to their duties.

However, due to stigma and symptom underestimation, students rarely seek effective stress management solutions. Conversational agents in the health sector have shown promise in reducing stress, depression, and anxiety. Nevertheless, research on their effectiveness for students with stress remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a conversational agent-delivered stress management coaching intervention for students called MISHA and to evaluate its effectiveness, engagement, and acceptance. METHODS: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, Swiss students experiencing stress were recruited on the web. Using a 1:1 randomization ratio, participants (N=140) were allocated to either the intervention or waitlist control group. Treatment effectiveness on changes in the primary outcome, that is, perceived stress, and secondary outcomes, including depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, and active coping, were self-assessed and evaluated using ANOVA for repeated measure and general estimating equations. RESULTS: The per-protocol analysis revealed evidence for improvement of stress, depression, and somatic symptoms with medium effect sizes (Cohen d=-0.36 to Cohen d=-0.60), while anxiety and active coping did not change (Cohen d=-0.29 and Cohen d=0.13). In the intention-to-treat analysis, similar results were found, indicating reduced stress (β estimate=-0.13, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.05; P<.001), depressive symptoms (β estimate=-0.23, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.08; P=.003), and psychosomatic symptoms (β estimate=-0.16, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.06; P=.003), while anxiety and active coping did not change. Overall, 60% (42/70) of the participants in the intervention group completed the coaching by completing the postintervention survey. They particularly appreciated the quality, quantity, credibility, and visual representation of information. While individual customization was rated the lowest, the target group fitting was perceived as high. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that MISHA is feasible, acceptable, and effective in reducing perceived stress among students in Switzerland. Future research is needed with different populations, for example, in students with high stress levels or compared to active controls.

Background: Nursing students experience higher levels of stress compared to their peers in other professions, and the cultivation of academic resilience plays a pivotal role in their ability to effectively cope with this stress. Academic resilience not only facilitates success in the face of academic adversity but also contributes to the promotion of mental well-being among nursing students. However, the current research on the academic resilience of nursing students has predominantly focused on a scale-centered total score approach, disregarding individual variability, and hindering the development to inform personalized interventions for enhancing academic resilience. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to collect a total of 644 nursing students from two medical schools in Guangzhou City. The participants were recruited through an online survey conducted from January to March 2023. The questionnaires consisted of a general information form, the Chinese version of the Academic Resilience Scale-30 (C-ARS-30), the 10-item Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Latent profile analysis was used to identify distinct categories of academic resilience among nursing students, and influencing factors were examined through ordinal logistic regression analysis. Results: The academic resilience levels of nursing students can be divided into three potential categories: 'low academic resilience' (13.0%), 'moderate academic resilience' (70.0%), and 'high academic resilience' (17.0%). Level of grade, GPA, self-reported physical health level, resilience and self-efficacy were significantly influenced the different categories of academic resilience of nursing students (P<0.05). Conclusions: The majority of undergraduate nursing students were placed in the moderate academic resilience group, however, educational institutions should pay special attention to nursing students demonstrating low levels. Regular assessments of academic resilience are recommended, and personalized interventions should be tailored to address specific academic resilience characteristics across different grades of nursing students. Strategies aimed at enhancing academic resilience among nursing students may include improvements in GPA performance, attention to physical health, and the reinforcement of resilience and self-efficacy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus"

These factors contribute to a decline in mental well-being and necessitate prompt intervention and assistance. The automation of mental health identification in students greatly benefits from the implementation of intelligent emotion recognition systems. Through the analysis of students' emotional states, educational institutions can gain a deeper understanding of students' mental well-being, enabling them to promptly identify and address any issues and offer more complete care and support to students. This paper proposes a method for automated emotion recognition that is driven by data. The method is developed based on the provided background information. The proposed approach incorporates a feature fusion mechanism and an attention mechanism into the ResNet-34 model. This integration enhances the model's capability to analyze intricate details and subsequently improves its classification performance when applied to electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This paper introduces several key innovations. First, an optimization technique is applied to the input component of the model, enabling multifeature fusion. Second, an attention mechanism is incorporated after the residual network module, enabling the model to prioritize parts that contribute to classification and enhance feature extraction. Finally, the network parameters are optimized using both softmax loss and center loss functions. The findings from the analysis of the sentiment EEG public data SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED) indicate that the proposed sentiment recognition approach not only enhances the classification performance of the model on the sentiment EEG data but also improves the stability of the results. This paper presents a novel approach that enables automatic and efficient recognition of students' emotions on commonly used platforms. The findings of this study hold significant implications for mental health assessment and detection in real-life production settings, offering substantial reference value in this domain. © 2024 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Elevated stress levels, mental distress, and psychiatric issues affect academic performance and thus may contribute to non-continuation. There is a lack of systematic reviews exploring the link between mental health and university non-continuation. Aim: This systematic review aims to bridge this gap, by investigating the prevalence of non-continuation and mental health conditions among university students, and the impact of mental health on university non-continuation. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines this review synthesized data from 67 studies, utilising both narrative synthesis and meta-analytic techniques. Results: The results revealed that the included studies reported a range of university non-continuation rates (5.9% to 43.6%) with a pooled prevalence of 17.9%, 95% CI [14.2%, 22.3%]. The prevalence of mental health concerns among students varied widely (2.2% to 83.6%), with a pooled prevalence of 26.3%, 95% CI [16.0%, 40.0%].

Kinesiology and Physical Therapy students face unique challenges that can affect their mental health. Objective: to determine the frequency of common mental disorders in kinesiology and physical therapy students at the Universidad Nacional de Asunción. Methodology: this was an observational and descriptive cross-sectional study. The nonprobabilistic sample included 150 Kinesiology and Physiotherapy students from the Universidad Nacional de Asunción. Sociodemographic, academic, occupational, lifestyle, and psychopathological data were collected using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The analysis was performed using Jamovi with multivariate binomial logistic regression. Results: the frequency of depression, anxiety, and stress was 61.3 %, 72 %, and 54.7 %, respectively. The significant factors for depression included being an irregular student, working, and not engaging in physical activity. For anxiety, being an irregular student and being a woman were significant. Regarding stress, being an irregular student, working, and not engaging in physical activity were found to be relevant. The resulting models had correct classifications of 90.2 %, 88 %, and 72 % for depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Conclusion: this study revealed a high frequency of depression, anxiety, and stress among kinesiology and physical therapy students, which was significantly associated with academic irregularity, employment, and a lack of physical activity. These findings underscore the need to implement intervention strategies and support programs that address these risk factors in order to promote the mental health and well-being of future health professionals. © 2024, Republica del Paraguay Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare.

Recognizing that there are many further steps to developing user-centred evidence-based approaches for mental health challenges, as a first step to developing effective interventions using intelligent agents, it is important to identify design elements and functionalities that are perceived as engaging and useful by students. In this paper, we present the findings of an online survey with 1054 undergraduate students to explore students’ perceptions of, and preferences for, using different types of intelligent agents (e.g., virtual agents, social robots, etc.) to support their mental well-being, specifically to cope with feelings of stress and anxiety in social situations typically encountered within a university context (e.g., engaging in a group discussion, delivering presentations, expressing opinions, etc.). Students were asked to complete a questionnaire to explore their experience of stress and anxiety in the university context, as well as their perceptions of, and preferences for using different intelligent agents as assistive tools to cope with such feelings. The results provide insights into different design elements as well as social and technical capabilities to consider when designing intelligent agents to help address stress and anxiety among university students. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Whereby, interfering with the dynamic progress in life. Also, anxiety is a product of stress and a major predictor of academic performance. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), measure levels of anxiety and perceived stress, evaluate the academic profile, identify lifestyle characteristics, and explore the relationship between these factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 340 Sudanese medical students filled out online questionnaires, composed of the sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, academic profile, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 scale (GAD-2), and Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10). Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 20.0 for data analysis. Results: Of 340 medical students, 3.8% of them were diagnosed with GAD, while 29.1% scored ≥ 3 in GAD-2, indicating a possible diagnosis. The study found that 9.7% of the participants used addictive substances, with 42% of them having high GAD-2 scores. Moreover, high anxiety levels were associated with high-stress scores (p-value = 0.000). Also, high GAD-2 scores were significantly associated with students who spent less than 10,000 SDG (18 USD) weekly, spent more time on entertainment using smart devices (p-value = 0.004), and had an unhealthy diet (p-value = 0.004). Low anxiety levels were associated with better sleep quality (p-value = 0.00), satisfaction with religious practices (p-value = 0.00), and increased leisure/hobby time (p-value = 0.018). High-stress levels were observed in females (p-value = 0.035), those with lower academic performance satisfaction levels, and increased hours of smart device usage for entertainment (p-value = 0.001). Reduced stress levels were associated with being ≥ 23 years old, increased leisure/hobby time (p-value = 0.002), satisfaction with religious practices [F(3, 166.6) = 10.8, p-value = 0.00)], and having a healthy diet (p-value = 0.006). Conclusion: The low prevalence of GAD corresponded with previous literature, but 29.1% of medical students had a high probability of having GAD. The study emphasizes on providing accessible mental health services for medical students and interventions addressing modifiable risk factors. © 2024, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Additionally, it evaluates the research methodologies and existing issues in current studies, providing an important agenda for future research. Research was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The findings suggest significant effects of forest therapy activities on the physiology and psychology of college students, notably improving the cardiovascular system, enhancing the immune system, boosting emotional well-being, alleviating job-related stress, and enhancing academic performance. This study further clarifies forest therapy as an emerging and effective intervention to reduce stress levels among college students, particularly when carried out continuously in easily accessible campus forest environments. Such therapeutic activities could serve as a component of daily stress-relieving programs for college students. This assessment offers valuable information for college students, educational institutions, and policymakers to promote the development of forest therapy on university campuses.

This study seeks to identify and investigate the primary stressors (sources of stress) in UK construction projects and to propose effective strategies for preventing or reducing stress in this context. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a qualitative multi-methods research approach, comprising the use of a comprehensive literature review, case study interviews and a focus group. It utilised an integrated deductive-inductive approach theory building using NVivo software. In total, 19 in-depth interviews were conducted as part of the case-study with a well-rounded sample of construction professionals and trade supervisors, followed by a focus group with 12 policy influencers and sector stakeholders to evaluate the quality and transferability of the findings of the study. Findings: The results reveal seven main stressors and 35 influencing factors within these 7 areas of stress in a UK construction project, with “workflow interruptions” emerging as the predominant stressor. In addition, the results of the focus-group, which was conducted with a sample of 12 prominent industry experts and policy influencers, indicate that the findings of the case study are transferrable and could be applicable to other construction projects and contexts. It is, therefore, recommended that these potential stressors be addressed by the project team as early as possible in construction projects. Additionally, the study sheds empirical light on the limitations of the critical path method and identifies “inclusive and collaborative planning” as a proactive strategy for stress prevention and/or reduction in construction projects. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study are mainly based on the perspectives of construction professionals at managerial and supervisory levels. It is, therefore, suggested that future studies are designed to focus on capturing the experiences and opinions of construction workers/operatives on the site. Practical implications: The findings from this study have the potential to assist decision-makers in the prevention of stress within construction projects, ultimately enhancing workforce performance. It is suggested that the findings could be adapted for use as Construction Supply Chain Management Standards to improve occupational stress management and productivity in construction projects. The study also provides decision-makers and practitioners with a conceptual framework that includes a list of effective strategies for stress prevention or reduction at both project and organisational levels. It also contributes to practice by offering novel ideas for incorporating occupational stress and mental health considerations into production planning and control processes in construction. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first, or one of the very few studies, to explore the concept of occupational stress in construction at the project and supply chain levels. It is also the first study to reveal “workflow” as a predominant stressor in construction projects. It is, therefore, suggested that both academic and industry efforts should focus on finding innovative ways to enhance workflow and collaboration in construction projects, to improve the productivity, health and well-being of their workforce and supply chain. Further, it is suggested that policymakers should consider the potential for incorporating “workflow” into the HSE's Management Standards for stress prevention and management. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

Most research focuses on average stress levels but lacks insights into temporal trends and inequalities. Using repeated longitudinal survey data on 33,000 students in Swedish compulsory school from the Evaluation Through Follow-up (ETF) study, we investigate temporal trends in stress across three cohorts of students (born 1992, 1998, and 2004), with a focus on inequalities by school year, sex, socio-economic status, migration background, school grades, and school difficulties. The results show that (1) stress increased more in year 6 than in year 9 in recent cohorts; (2) stress increased more for girls than for boys; and (3) low school grades and school difficulties have become stronger risk factors for stress.

Increased stress can negatively impact students' physical conditions and academic performance. Objective: This study aims to incorporate the NIH “Press Reset on Stress” strategies of deep breathing, PMR, and mindfulness into the curriculum for DPT students and evaluate their effectiveness on student-perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. Methods: The research design was a quasi-experimental study. Participants (n = 39) were current DPT students. Weekly Interventions of 5–10 min deep breathing, mindfulness, or progressive muscle relaxation were performed over 13 sessions. Data points of weeks 0,7, and 13 were used to collect outcome measure scores on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21(DASS-21), and the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), while the Stress Numeric Scale (SNS) was collected weekly.

However, especially university students are insufficiently physically active because of difficulties in time management regarding study, work, and social demands. As they are at a crucial life stage, it is of interest how physical activity affects university students' stress load and recovery as well as their academic performance. Methods: Student´s behavior during home studying in times of COVID-19 was examined longitudinally on a daily basis during a ten-day study period (N = 57, aged M = 23.5 years, SD = 2.8, studying between the 1st to 13th semester (M = 5.8, SD = 4.1)). Two-level regression models were conducted to predict daily variations in stress load, recovery and perceived academic performance depending on leisure-time physical activity and short physical activity breaks during studying periods. Parameters of the individual home studying behavior were also taken into account as covariates. Results: While physical activity breaks only positively affect stress load (functional stress b = 0.032, p < 0.01) and perceived academic performance (b = 0.121, p < 0.001), leisure-time physical activity affects parameters of stress load (functional stress: b = 0.003, p < 0.001, dysfunctional stress: b = -0.002, p < 0.01), recovery experience (b = -0.003, p < 0.001) and perceived academic performance (b = 0.012, p < 0.001). Home study behavior regarding the number of breaks and longest stretch of time also shows associations with recovery experience and perceived academic performance. Conclusions: Study results confirm the importance of different physical activities for university students` stress load, recovery experience and perceived academic performance in home studying periods. Universities should promote physical activity to keep their students healthy and capable of performing well in academic study: On the one hand, they can offer opportunities to be physically active in leisure time. On the other hand, they can support physical activity breaks during the learning process and in the immediate location of study. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This stress has been linked to declining academic performance and worsening mental health. To combat these negative outcomes, it is essential for medical school faculty and administration to address common stressors among medical students. No studies have addressed whether medical school faculty and students perceive stressors similarly, however. Methods: In this two-part study, data collected from medical students in 2021 to 2022 to identify their most significant sources of stress were used to create a survey that queries the frequency and intensity of these stressors. This survey was distributed to medical students and faculty at the same institution. The responses between students and faculty were compared and student data also were analyzed by academic year to observe changes in perception that accompany progression through the medical curriculum. Results: The results showed that faculty overestimated the impact of certain stressors on medical students (eg, in-house examinations, US Medical Licensing Examination Steps 1 and 2 examinations, and patient interactions). In addition, preclinical students were more concerned with finding extracurricular activities, missing opportunities, and performing research compared with clinical students. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that although faculty anticipated most medical student stressors, there are significant gaps that still need to be addressed to better reduce and respond to the stress experienced by medical students. © 2024 by The Southern Medical Association.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Similarly, college-level students encounter heightened stress and fatigue while pursuing academic goals and engaging in different activities. Stress, a non-specific response to various demands, and fatigue, characterized by extreme tiredness, are prevalent health conditions experienced across a spectrum of intensity in daily life. In this study, we conduct an extensive analysis to address a fundamental question: how do stress, sleep disturbance, and fatigue experiences differ between pilots and non-pilot college students? Delving into stress and fatigue levels within these populations contributes to understanding these phenomena and their potential implications for overall well-being and performance. Building on a comprehensive analysis of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) scores, we explore variations in stress, sleep disturbance, and fatigue across multiple dimensions. Our findings indicate intriguing disparities among pilot and non-pilot cohorts. Through graphical representations and statistical tests, we reveal that non-pilot college students exhibit higher perceived stress and sleep disturbance levels. In contrast, pilots demonstrate expected higher perceived fatigue levels. Our detailed analysis of subcategories, including General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Reduced Activity, Reduced Motivation, and Mental Fatigue, sheds light on the complexity of these differences. Notably, pilot students experience heightened fatigue, potentially linked to the demanding nature of their tasks. In conclusion, our extended analysis contributes valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of stress, sleep disturbance, and fatigue among pilot and non-pilot college students. These findings hold implications for future research and interventions aimed at enhancing the well-being and performance of individuals in these distinct educational and professional domains. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Yet, it remains unclear how adolescent mental health changed during the transition of school reopening as well as the academic-related risk and protective factors. Methods: Immediately before (April 2020) and three months (July 2020) after school reopening, 879 adolescents in Shanghai, China (mean age = 13.14 years, standard deviation = 1.31, 51% girls) completed online surveys and reported on their mental health (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and anger problems). Adolescents also reported perceived academic stress and academic orientations (i.e., performance orientation and mastery orientation) before school reopening. Results: Adolescents reported decreased depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and anger problems three months after school reopening. Adolescents who reported higher perceived academic stress and performance orientation showed elevated mental health symptoms after school reopening, whereas those reported higher mastery orientation showed decreased anger problems. Higher mastery orientation buffered the negative influence of academic stress on mental health. Discussion: The findings not only demonstrate the positive influence of school reopening on Chinese adolescents' mental health but also highlight the role of perceived academic stress and academic orientations in contributing to individual differences during this transition. © 2024 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Stress and perfection are associated with IP, impairing professional and academic performance and negatively impacting mental health. The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of IP and perfectionism in dental hygiene students and the relationship with stress. Methods: This study used cross-sectional survey research with a nonprobability sampling of dental hygiene students (n = 258). The study used three validated instruments: the Imposter Profile (IPP30) with six subscales, the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale Brief with two subscales, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10). Descriptive, correlation, and linear regression were used for analysis. Results: The completion rate was 74.8% (n = 193). Linear regression analysis found the competence doubt (CD) subscale of the Imposter-Profile and perfectionistic striving (PS) were the only statistically significant predictors of stress (F = 10.01, p <.001, R2 =.16). CD (b = 0.36, p < 0.001) was twice as strong as PS (b = 0.15, p < 0.05) in predicting stress in dental hygiene students. Conclusion: In this sample of dental hygiene students, the doubt about competence aspect of imposter phenomenon increased stress more than the striving for perfectionism.

Research into alternative treatment methods suggests that lifestyle behaviors are safer and more effective than medication at reducing MI symptoms. This study explores the relationship between lifestyle behaviors and MI in college women through an online survey. The survey included a food frequency questionnaire (Diet History Questionnaire II) and questions about lifestyle behaviors, symptoms of MI, and sociodemographic information. Diet quality was calculated using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and MI was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. Independent sample t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square analyses were conducted. A total of 222 women completed the survey. Overall, diet quality was poor, with a mean HEI of 62.6 ± 10.4. No significant differences or associations were found between MI groups for total HEI score, sleep, or tobacco use. However, alcohol use was significantly associated with MI (p = 0.049). Individuals with fewer concurrent unhealthy lifestyle behaviors had less severe symptoms of depression (p = 0.009) and anxiety (p < 0.001) compared to those with more unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. In this study, alcohol use was the only independent lifestyle behavior associated with symptoms of MI. We also found an association between the number of concurrent unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and depression and anxiety symptoms.

This national study aims to estimate the prevalence of opioid misuse, examine correlates with anxiety and depression symptoms, and quantify help-seeking behaviors among U.S. college students. Methods: Data come from students in the Healthy Minds Study between 2017 and 2020 (n = 176,191). Validated screening tools assessed mental health symptoms (PHQ-9, GAD-7). Marginal effects of logistic regression models estimate the effect of opioid misuse on mental health symptoms, help-seeking and academic performance. Results: 782 students indicated past month opioid misuse. Student opioid misuse was associated with 24.1 percentage point increase in the probability of screening positive for anxiety/depression (p < 0.001) and 3.6 percentage point increase in the probability of informal help-seeking (p = 0.017). Less than half of students with opioid misuse and a positive depression/anxiety screen received any treatment in the past year. Limitations: Limitations to this study include: possible non-response bias, as it is unknown whether students with opioid misuse may be differentially-likely to respond to the survey; differing time frame for opioid misuse and mental health questions; and data was collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: This large, multi-campus study underlines the need for more partnership between substance use and mental health services on campus. It also highlights that college peers could receive training in ways to best help students who misuse opioids, directing them to on- or off-campus care. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The present study aimed to assess the relationship between physical health, mental health, and university students’ success, and to explore the associations between these factors and their academic achievement. Methods: A cross-sectional, self-administered online survey was used to collect data from college students in three different universities in Lebanon during the Fall 2023 semester. Mental health was evaluated using validated screening tools for depression, anxiety, and stress, specifically the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), respectively. Additionally, general questions regarding physical health and lifestyle factors were incorporated into the questionnaire. Academic achievement was measured using students’ grade point average (GPA). Results: A total of 261 students completed the self-administered online survey. The results revealed that approximately 42% and 36% of students were experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively, and 75.1% of students exhibited symptoms of moderate stress. The majority of participants (99.2%) did not report any physical disability. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant association between mental health status (depression, anxiety, and stress) and GPA level (p = 0.03, p = 0.044, p = 0.015, respectively). Multiple logistic regression models identified eight correlates of GPA and highlighted the relationship between physical health and student success. For instance, students who considered themselves moderately active had lower odds of achieving a higher GPA than those who considered themselves active (OR = 0.41, p = 0.045). Conclusions: This is the first investigation into Lebanese university students’ academic success in relation to lifestyle and mental health profiles. The findings indicate that implementing public health programs and interventions targeting mental health and lifestyle behaviors is essential for enhancing student success. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study population consisted of 25,681 second-year middle school students who participated in the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey in 2020–2022. Participants were asked about their bedtime and wake-up time during the past 7 days and were classified into five categories. The study compared the general characteristics, academic factors, dietary habits, and mental health of urban and rural students based on their bedtime. RESULTS: Bedtime was found to be later in the following order: urban female students, rural female students, urban male students, and rural male students. As bedtime got later, the rates of smoking and alcohol consumption increased. Students who went to bed before 11 p.m. had lower academic performance, while rural male students who went to bed after 2 a.m. had lower academic performance. Later bedtime was associated with increased smartphone usage, skipping breakfast, consuming fast food, and drinking carbonated beverages. Later bedtime was also associated with higher perceived stress levels, particularly among students who went to bed after 2 a.m., higher rates of suicidal ideation, experiencing sadness and despair, as well as the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety disorders. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that middle school students who go to bed too late have higher rates of smoking and alcohol drinking, as well as unhealthy eating habits, stress, suicidal ideation, sadness, and anxiety. Therefore, it is necessary to provide educational and social institutional support to promote adequate sleep for the health of adolescents. © 2024 The Korean Nutrition Society and the Korean Society of Community Nutrition.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Stress among them can’t be overlooked and is also of major concern as it not only impacts their academic performances but also their mental health, and increases emotional exhaustion. There are many factors that are involved in causing stress among students. Doctoral students are more prone to it as it demands time, selfless effort, and much sacrifice. Moreover, they are in the stage where there are a lot of things going on that distract their minds or sometimes contradict their decisions be it related to their future or to their family, or be it from the institute side. This article mainly deals with analyzing the factors which cause stress, their effects on Ph.D. students, how these factors interrelate with each other, and their percentage share in causing this. Seven dimensions/factors are explored i.e., Institutional Issues, Personal Issues, Supervisor relations, Academic Issues, Fears, Mental Health, and Time Management, which overall depict the entire Doctoral journey. For the analysis of all these dimensions and for finding out the percentage share, a new hybrid method of MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) i.e., fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP with the triangular approach of responses i.e., Optimistic, Pessimistic & Most-Likely is proposed. Performance Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis are done to do the validity check and robustness of the proposed model and by doing this analysis, we identified that the most likely approach in the proposed model is most reliable than the Optimistic and Pessimistic approach due to its non-biased behavior and Supervisor feedback and Uncertain future are the most influential factors and change of city is the least influential one. Moreover, Academic Issues (Poor Writing Skills as well as Publication issues) together with Satisfaction with topic selection during course work period as well as the supervisor's feedback contributes more with weights of 8.1%, 7.7% & 7.5% respectively in causing stress to the doctoral students. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

In this paper, we propose and evaluate several computational models for mental health assessment based on demographic, academic, and psychological factors. Hence, this paper implemented the Probabilistic Deep Belief Bayesian Network (PDBBN) to classify students’ mental health attributes. The proposed PDBBN network computes the probabilistic value of the mental health assessment of the students. With the estimation of the probabilistic model, the extracted features are applied in the Deep Belief Bayesian Network for the classification of student mental health with the Macromedia analysis in college students. The classification is performed with the consideration of information on gender, age, academic performance, social support scores, and self-reported levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, and each model across multiple epochs. Simulation is conducted in comparison with the proposed PDBBN model with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. The results indicate that PDBBN consistently outperforms CNN and DNN in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The simulation analysis of results stated that the proposed PDBBN model achieves a higher classification accuracy of 0.98 which is significantly higher than the CNN and DNN models. Additionally, the proposed PDBBN model expressed that mental health of the students significantly impacts in the academic performance of the students. ©2024: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Internet addiction (IA) refers to excessive Internet usage in an uncontrolled and time-consuming manner, causing loss of time and disruption of daily life. However, the prevalence of IA may vary according to age, sex, and ethnicity, and is more prevalent among college students. There is a strong link between problematic Internet usage and an increased risk of developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD and depression symptoms. Medical students were chosen for this study due to their unique stressors, including rigorous academic demands, extensive study hours, and clinical practice requirements. It is critical to address behavioral addictions and their psychological effects in this group, as they are linked to the future quality of healthcare provision compared with their non-medical peers. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of Problematic Internet Use (PIU) in medical students and explore their correlation with the medical students’ PTSD and Patient Health Questionnaire −9 (PHQ9) scores. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted including 506 medical students in the second year of medical school up to internship year at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University (IAU) between June 2021 and January 2022. The questionnaire consisted of consent forms, sociodemographic data, and screening tools for PTSD, the GPIU, and PHQ-9. Results: The prevalence of problematic internet usage (PIU) was 30.6% in the sample group. Students with moderate-to-moderately severe PTSD were 1.7 times more likely to have PIU OR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.091, 2.879). Students with moderate to severe depression were 2.2 times more likely to have PIU OR (95% CI); 2.2 (1.333, 3.950).Having a Saudi nationality, lower income, and being single was significantly associated with PIU. Conclusion: Single Saudi medical students with lower income are at risk of developing more problematic internet use.

Medical students are a particularly vulnerable category due to the demanding nature of their training, as they are often exposed to headache trigger factors. We therefore aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and healthcare-seeking practices of primary headaches among Italian medical students. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among medical students attending the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome who completed a self-administered questionnaire designed following the International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 criteria. The questionnaire assessed sociodemographic and headache features, healthcare utilization, the use of symptomatic and preventive treatment, and headache trigger factors. Results: Five hundred thirty-six students filled out the questionnaire. The lifetime and last-year prevalence of headache in this cohort was 76.7% (n = 411). Among the students surveyed, migraine had a prevalence of 26.9%, probable migraine of 12.9%, and tension-type headache (TTH)/probable TTH of 36.9%. Two hundred and forty-six students (59.8%) reported that their headache worsened after starting university. All students reporting headache had at least one trigger factor. In students fulfilling the criteria for migraine (n = 144), 137 (95.1%) had previously used acute non-prescription treatments, and eight concurrently used a preventive treatment. Thirty-five students fulfilling the criteria for migraine underwent a brain MRI scan (24.3%), 43 performed a neurological evaluation (29.9%), 36 received a diagnosis of migraine (25%), and 20 (13.9%) accessed the emergency room. Discussion: Migraine and TTH are common among medical students in Italy despite low healthcare resource utilization. These results support the need to promote public health policies and strategies in order to reduce the disability and burden associated with primary headaches among medical students. © Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Objective: to determine whether coping with stress and self-efficacy predict the academic satisfaction of university students. Methods: a quantitative, non-experimental, predictive, and cross-sectional study was conducted. The sample consisted of 301 students who were administered the Academic Stress Coping Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Academic Satisfaction Scale, all instruments with adequate psychometric properties. Results: preliminarily, it was found that academic satisfaction correlated significantly and directly with coping with stress (r= 0,449; p<0,05) and self-efficacy (r= 0,521; p<0,05). Likewise, coping with stress was found to correlate significantly and directly with self-efficacy (r= 0,438; p<0,05). Regression analysis demonstrated a suitable fit for the model (F= 53,128; p<0,05), where coping with stress (β= 0,302; p<0,05) and self-efficacy (β= 0,491; p<0,05) explained 27,3 % of the total variance of the academic satisfaction variable. Conclusions: coping with stress and self-efficacy predict the academic satisfaction of university students. Therefore, the implementation of specific strategies is recommended, thus fostering a more conducive academic environment for student well-being and academic success. © 2024; Los autores.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, the gap was highlighted about the influence of college students’ religious beliefs, particularly those of the evil eyes, on their academic failures. Based on this notion, this study aims to explore how evil eye beliefs affect students’ academic experiences with failures in a culturally diverse educational environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study included 18 female Sunni-Muslim students from Kuwait University by using Heidegger’s phenomenological framework. The study conducted 18 face-to-face interviews over four weeks and analyzed the data using NVivo 14 with thematic analysis and phenomenological assumptions. Findings: This in-depth study shows how the pervasive belief in the evil eye in academic settings challenges students. The study found how this cultural belief affects students’ mental health, academic performance and social interactions. The study also explored cultural sensitivity’s wider implications, how educational institutions face the psychological stress this belief causes, cultural effects on academic failure and student coping mechanisms. Research limitations/implications: Because the study was qualitative and exploratory, the findings provide depth rather than breadth of understanding about students’ evil eye perceptions. The study does not consider the possibility that “evil eye” beliefs might be psychological delusions, complicating cultural beliefs and mental health symptoms. This oversight makes it challenging to select participants who have genuinely experienced evil eye effects. Teachers interviewed students who might withhold private information or alter their responses due to power dynamics or a desire to appear positive. This setting might bias data, reducing its authenticity and depth. Practical implications: The study suggests that academic institutions should address cultural beliefs to support students’ education and academic performance rather than promoting hate, evil eye and oppression. Originality/value: This study highlights the need for academic environments to address and mitigate the evil eye belief’s unique challenges, creating a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for all students. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

Physical activity has been linked to a number of beneficial effects on cognitive function, including increased memory and executive function in adults, improved academic performance in children and adolescents, and potential advantages for people with cognitive impairments or neurodegenerative diseases. Increased cerebral blood flow, the synthesis of neurotrophic factors, and a decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation are the processes driving these effects. Studies have shown that exercise has mood‑regulating benefits, with symptoms of anxiety and sadness lessening as a result. These mood‑enhancing effects are a result of the endocannabinoid system being activated, endorphins being released, and changes in self‑esteem and body image. Exercise therapies have also demonstrated the potential to encourage cognitive health as people age and lower the likelihood of cognitive decline. Exercise has been investigated as an adjuvant treatment for mental health illnesses, such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders, in addition to its preventive effects. Exercise can improve the effectiveness of treatment and general wellbeing when it is incorporated into comprehensive treatment strategies. To identify the ideal exercise parameters for certain outcomes and overcome barriers to exercise participation, more study is necessary. We can get closer to enhancing general wellbeing and quality of life by including exercise in measures for promoting mental health and cognitive health. © 2024 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

It is mainly characterized by perfectionism and can cause distress and functional impairment in the individual. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of OCPD in medical students, investigate the effect of this disorder on students’ academic performance, and discover any possible related factors. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study consisted of 508 medical students enrolled at the University of Jordan in 2021. It utilized a questionnaire that enquired about their sociodemographic information, academic information, and study habits. It also contained questions about the diagnostic criteria of OCPD from the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and questions from the Personality Inventory for the DSM-5 (PID-5) to assess the presence of the rigid perfectionism personality trait. Results: Fifty-one percent of the studied sample either fulfilled the DSM-5 criteria or showed moderate or high expression of rigid perfectionism, according to the PID-5. More than two-thirds of the students able to be diagnosed with OCPD reported being overwhelmed with anxiety and stress at times of exams, and 41.5% stated that they skip sleep before exams even though they have finished studying. Conclusion: The reported prevalence of 51.18% in medical students is ten times the prevalence of OCPD in the general population. There was no association between OCPD and the students’ gender or academic performance. Students affected by OCPD seem to experience overwhelming amounts of stress and may need mental health support in the form of regular check-ups and counseling services. © 2024 DSR Publishers ∕ The University of Jordan.

It can eventually lead to dropout and academic dissatisfaction. Emotional intelligence may play an essential role in decreasing the emotional effects of stress, such as academic burnout in nursing students. However, emotional intelligence is conceptualized multidimensionally, and each of its attributes may have a different impact on burnout reduction. Objective: To explore the dimensions of emotional intelligence that may mediate the association between academic performance (course failure) and academic burnout in nursing students. Design: The design was cross-sectional, with survey-based data collection. Settings: Educational setting, undergraduate nursing students at a private university in Metropolitan Lima, Peru. Participants: 154 students (77.3 % female) with a mean age of 25.9 years. Methods: A multiple mediation strategy was used, using the Wong-Law Emotional Intelligence Scale. Four emotional intelligence attributes (self-emotional appraisal, others' emotional appraisal, use of emotion, and regulation of emotion) were evaluated in the relationship of failed courses (dichotomous variable: yes/no) and academic burnout (single item based on physical and emotional exhaustion). The structural equation modeling framework was used. Results: Course failure (academic performance) positively affects academic burnout. Regulation of emotion is the only dimension of emotional intelligence mediating between course failure and academic burnout. The proportion of the mediating effect was 0.315, while the rest was around zero. Statistically significant gender differences were detected concerning burnout, with men scoring moderately higher than women. Conclusions: The results indicate that the regulation of emotion may have a relevant role in reducing burnout compared to other emotional intelligence attributes. These regulatory skills are important for developing health care and positive patient relationships. Interventions focused on the regulatory characteristics of emotions and distinguishing different attributes of emotional intelligence while exploring its mediating effect should be strengthened. These implications are linked to the growing call to include EI in university education. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The study was conducted in Beijing, China, with the participation of 600 students, including 300 first-year students and 300 fifth-year students. DASS (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) questionnaires were employed to measure mental health. The DASS assesses symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, while the PHQ-9 specifically evaluates depression severity. Academic performance was evaluated using a 12-point scale, which incorporated various criteria such as exam scores, coursework performance, and participation in extracurricular activities. The research was conducted across five faculties of the university from 2022 to 2023. In the study, fifth-year students demonstrated a higher level of mental health compared to first-year students, with an average DASS score of 27.1 and 24.2, respectively. Interestingly, despite this, first-year students achieved higher academic performance indicators, with an average score of 8.2 compared to 9.8 in fifth-year students. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between stress, depression, and anxiety levels with academic performance (stress: r = −0.25, p < 0.001; depression: r = −0.20, p = 0.003; anxiety: r = −0.18, p = 0.008). These findings highlight the critical importance of addressing students' mental well-being, particularly in later academic years.

Students that have been exposed to a traumatic and adverse experience present with high rates of dropout, low academic performance, conduct problems, aggression, depression, and anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between self-reported trauma symptoms of students identified with behavioral concerns using teacher reported screening data and whether hurricane exposure moderates the relationship. Participants included 75 students from elementary, middle, and high school in a large school district in the Southeastern United States. Students completed a self-rating of their trauma symptoms and hurricane exposure while their teachers completed a universal screening of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results from this study indicated that the type of hurricane exposure does not significantly moderate the relationship between trauma symptoms and students’ internalizing and externalizing behaviors. While linear regression showed that students who reported higher levels post traumatic symptoms have higher ratings of internalizing behaviors, results also indicated that there was no significant relationship between trauma symptoms and externalizing behaviors. Result suggest that trauma-informed strategies should be incorporated into the process of universal screening of behavior within the school setting to ensure that students at-risk for internalizing mental health concerns receive early intervention services. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

The COVID-19 pandemic, the political turmoil and a coup in Sudan has exacerbated stress and anxiety among university students in Sudan due to uncertainty about their academic activities. Aim: To assess post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurrence and coping strategies adopted by university students in Sudan. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to June 2022. It used the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaires to assess the occurrence of PTSD and coping strategies among 596 university students in Sudan. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the frequency and percentage, Student's t test was used to compare the means of 2 groups and one-way analysis of variance to compare the means of ≥ 3 groups. Results: There was a high prevalence of PTSD among the students, with a score of 31.2 (SD 16.4). The total score of PTSD was higher among female students. Around 36% of the students had a PTSD score > 37, which is considered high enough to suppress immune function. The most widely adopted coping strategies were religion and acceptance of the situation, while substance use was the least. Students who had COVID-19 infection during the pandemic differed significantly from uninfected students in the application of coping strategies. In contrast, students whose family members or friends had COVID-19 were not significantly different from students with uninfected family members or friends in the application of the coping strategies, such as self-blame, denial, substance use, and behavioural disengagement. Conclusion: We recommend the initiation and implementation of psychological counselling programmes for university students in Sudan onsite or remotely. Further research should be carried out to assess the long-term effects of the pandemic and the political conflicts so as to design and implement appropriate and efficient interventions. © Authors 2024; Licensee: World Health Organization.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Today's fast-paced world causes stress and strain, affecting physical and mental health. The study focuses on stress among students who are anxious owing to competition and performance-oriented objectives. The study describes academic stress, deliberates its causes, and discusses its impacts and manifestations. Factors affecting the perception of stress for a sample of 633 college students in Delhi-NCR are examined. Learner assessment of stress perception is measured using twenty-five items with responses collected on a 5-point Likert Scale. Additionally, the perceived impact of stress on the health and productivity of learners is also examined using six items. The ordered logistic regression model is employed to empirically examine the impact of demographic factors, home and college environments, as well as anxiety about the future on perceived stress amongst the respondents. More than 65 percent of respondents reported facing medium or high levels of stress perception. The study finds no difference in the average stress perception based on gender, but academic pressure, family income and teachers, peer and parental pressure emerge as stress-contributing factors. Examination, curriculum, and time pressures appear to be the most significant factors affecting stress perception. An increase in perception regarding examination, curriculum and time pressures significantly increases the ordered log-odds of moving to the higher stress perception category by 1.19 units. The study makes a compelling case for shifting the focus of education from purely academic to students' holistic development. Given the increase in stress perception, coping strategies for stress management are desperately needed. Recreational activities and the provision of appropriate counselling services by higher education institutions are imperative in this respect.

With an emphasis on undergraduate students, this systematic literature review (SLR) investigates the relationship between engineering education and mental health. Nineteen articles were chosen carefully, and once they were all examined, important topics and a summary of the literature were determined. Exam anxiety, social identities, and coping strategies, academic success, mental health identification and intervention, learning factors, and cognitive processes are just a few of the subjects that the SLR clarifies for engineering students. Five search phrases were used in this analysis: well-being + engineering, depression + engineering, anxiety + engineering, mental health + engineering, and mental illness + engineering. Seven databases were used, such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Engineering Village, ERIC, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library, to examine these phrases. Four themes emerged through the SLR: mental health identification and intervention, social identities and coping strategies, academic performance and test anxiety, learning factors and cognitive mechanisms. The research emphasizes the complexity of mental health problems faced by engineering students and the need for specific support systems and therapies. The findings highlight the significance of treating stress, anxiety, and depression in engineering students, and they offer suggestions for empowering them with useful coping mechanisms and customized support. The study also identifies areas in which further research is needed, such as the underrepresentation of specific demographic groups and the need for longitudinal techniques to fully understand the outcomes of lengthy treatments. The research summary emphasizes how important it is to give mental health in engineering significant importance instruction. In addition to achieving academic and professional success, students may promote healthy relationships and their general well-being by identifying and resolving mental health issues. The study ends by promoting evidence-based strategies to improve the cognitive and emotional aspects of student development, such as peer-led team learning and extensive support networks. Given the circumstances, this SLR offers a comprehensive viewpoint on mental health in engineering education, providing insightful information to practitioners, legislators, and academics to direct future initiatives fostering student well-being and academic success. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Path analysis findings suggest that greater levels of COVID-19 distress was associated with lower self-reported predicted GPA. Metacognitive, motivational, and social and emotional challenges emerged as the most salient challenge areas that fully mediated the relationship between COVID-19 psychological distress and self-reported predicted GPA. Specifically, COVID-19 distress predicted greater levels of metacognitive and motivational challenges which, in turn, predicted lower self-reported GPA. Similarly, greater levels of COVID-19 distress predicted more social and emotional challenges but these challenges were associated to higher perceived GPA.

This study investigated the consequences of children's exposure to domestic violence among parents on a range of children's outcomes: mental health, well-being, school performance and placement in out-of-home care. We used administrative records from full population cohorts of children in Denmark (N = 399 519, born 1997–2003). We examined a target group of children exposed to domestic violence and a comparison group not exposed to it, both groups having similar personal and family backgrounds, including pre-birth history of family domestic violence. To construct the comparison group, we used propensity score matching. Exposure to domestic violence had a substantial negative impact on academic performance (age 9–15), self-reported well-being in school (age 10–15) and also increased the likelihood of being placed in out-of-home care (age 9–15) and being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (age 9–15). The discounted additional cost (medical and child welfare system) per child indirectly experiencing domestic violence was at least $31 000 (age 0–15). Thus, our results show important adverse effects and suggest that earlier prevention and more preventive social interventions could help reduce the long-term consequences of childhood exposure to domestic violence. © 2023 The Authors.

This study investigates the efficacy of a resilience intervention program based on the three-factor model of personal resilience in reducing academic procrastination among Egyptian primary school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This quasi-experimental research involved a sample of 100 fourth-grade students who demonstrated high levels of procrastination, indicated by scores above 70% on the Pure Procrastination Scale. Students were randomly divided into two groups—an experimental group, which received resilience training, and a control group, which did not—to assess the intervention’s impact on academic procrastination. Qualitative analyses of the feedback from students, teachers, and parents, coupled with pre-and post-intervention questionnaires, were utilized to evaluate the program’s effectiveness. Initial findings revealed no significant differences between the groups before the intervention. However, significant improvements in the experimental group’s procrastination levels were observed immediately and one month after the intervention, suggesting the potential ability of resilience training to enhance students’ academic performance and well-being. Results advocate for the inclusion of resilience-building activities within educational curricula to effectively address academic procrastination. The purpose of this study is to propose suggestions to reduce academic procrastination in primary school students. These results have implications for educators and professionals working with children, emphasizing the value of fostering resilience skills to support academic achievement and well-being. © 2024 Conscientia Beam.

Students' motivation, attention, and social ties can all be impacted by mental illness, all of which are key factors in their academic achievement. Despite the widespread use of emergency remote learning (ERL) by educational institutes during the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about the elements that influence student satisfaction and stress levels in this innovative learning environment in a crisis. Our research uses machine learning algorithms to predict the stress faced by students based on their academic routines, thus providing a timely assessment of the pandemic's impact on students' stress levels. Data collected through student surveys relating to factors such as time spent on studying, social media, health and fitness etc. provide a strong basis to determine students' stress levels. Via supervised machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) etc., predictions are made on academic stress levels by analyzing the prime factors affecting the issue at hand, and a comprehensive comparison is performed with the proposal of the most optimum algorithm for the prediction of stress level.  © 2024 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Physical activity interventions within classroom settings have been acknowledged as a critical strategy to increase students’ movement behaviors while enhancing their academic achievement and health. Yet, the busy curriculum and challenging educational demands encourage more sedentary classroom behavior. Hence, this study aims to develop and evaluate an in-classroom physical activity breaks (IcPAB) intervention among fifth graders in Sri Lanka. Methods: The study will adopt a randomized controlled trial (RCT), comprising an in-classroom physical activity breaks program group and a control group to evaluate the effects of IcPAB on academic achievement, movement behaviors and health outcomes. The intervention design is based on the capability (C), opportunity (O) and motivation (M) behavior (B) (COM-B) model. A least 198 fifth graders will be recruited from two schools in Uva province, Sri Lanka. The recruitment process will start in late 2022. Class teachers of the intervention group will implement 5-min activity breaks at least three times a day after completing a training session. The primary variables include mathematics and reading achievement. The secondary variables include physical activity levels, steps count, sedentary behavior, body mass index, aerobic fitness, and perceived stress. Data collection will be implemented at pre-test and post-test, respectively. Intervention fidelity and the process will also be evaluated. Discussion: The IcPAB is designed to prevent pure educational time loss by introducing curriculum-integrated short bouts of physical active breaks into the classroom routine. If the IcPAB is effective, it can (1) improve the mathematics and reading achievement of fifth-grade girls and boys, which is a significant factor determining the performance at the Grade Five National Scholarship Examination in Sri Lanka; (2) improve movement behaviors as well as physical and mental health outcomes among primary school students. Sequentially, the IcPAB will enrich school-based physical activity intervention approaches which can in turn bring academic and health benefits to primary school children in Sri Lanka. Trial registration: The first version of the trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry (Ref: ISRCTN52180050) on 20/07/2022.

Six comprehensive electronic databases yielded 1316 studies that were systematically reviewed in Covidence to identify relevant research. PRISMA-ScR analysis was used. Eighty-three studies met the eligibility requirements. NVivo was employed for coding, data extraction, and analysis. Key findings suggest substance use, in particular, alcohol, is the main mental health concern among adolescents in high socioeconomic status groups. Other main mental health concerns were externalizing and risk behaviors, bullying, depression, anxiety and stress. These concerns were shown to be influenced by parents, peers, school, and neighborhood contextual factors. Three emerging subgroups were identified as being at higher risk of mental health concerns among adolescents in high socioeconomic status groups. Specifically, adolescents residing in boarding schools, those with high subjective social status (e.g., popular) or low academic performance. Being pressured by parents to perform well academically was identified as a risk-factor for substance use, depression and anxiety.

Method: A survey was conducted involving 200 graduate students from China. Furthermore, the study aimed to explore diverse cultural experiences and foster meaningful social connections. Some students engaged in physical activities to enhance their physical appearance or academic performance. Results: The research utilized the SCL-90 inventory to compare the mental health profiles of graduate students, revealing that 70% were inclined towards sports and exercise, while 30% showed no interest. This variance could be attributed to inadequate sports management structures, lack of requirement for physical activity among graduate students, and resource limitations. Graduate program enrolees exhibited higher levels of both psychological and physical ailments. Despite relatively minor differences, factors such as obsession, sadness, and anxiety showed statistically significant variations. This study underscores the positive impact of regular physical exercise on mental health, particularly in mitigating symptoms of sadness and anxiety. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of promoting physical activity among graduate students to enhance their overall well-being and mental health.

The pandemic’s restrictions disproportionately affected students in countries with significant enrolments, leading to detrimental impacts on their academic performance, social bonds, and future prospects. This narrative review aims to address the current knowledge gap concerning COVID-19’s impact on the mental health of international students and associated factors. Additionally, it endeavors to evaluate mental health issues, identify risk factors, and explore coping mechanisms employed by these students amidst the challenges posed by COVID-19 restrictions. Methods: This study employed a narrative review method to examine the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the mental health of international students during the pandemic. PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, ProQuest Central, and Science Direct databases, were searched for articles published from January 2020 to April 2023. The PRISMA guidelines utilized to guide the search strategy. Following the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 12 articles were selected for final evaluation and review. The credibility, significance, and outcomes of these articles were assessed using the CASP tool. Key Content and Findings: A thematic analysis strategy was employed to extract data from the chosen articles. The review revealed three primary themes: sociodemographic traits of international students, stressors linked to lockdown measures, and coping strategies amid COVID-19 restrictions, with eleven subthemes identified. Authors noted international students encountered diverse pandemic-induced stresses, heightening depression, stress and anxiety during restrictions. Moreover, the adoption of coping mechanisms during lockdown correlated with decreased prevalence of mental health disorders among international students, as observed in the reviewed literature. Conclusions: The mental health of international students suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic due to various factors arising from enforced restrictions, such as financial strain, academic hurdles, and inadequate support systems. Thematic analyses underscored the urgency to tackle deficient social support, and declining mental wellbeing, particularly among higher education students in countries with substantial enrolments. It’s imperative for education institutions to devise effective strategies to bolster students’ mental health and address psychological issues, especially considering the challenge of seeking social support during a global crisis like the recent COVID-19 pandemic. © Journal of Public Health and Emergency.

Academic life exposes college students to multiple adjustments, demands, and vulnerabilities that can cause stress and mental health problems. This study aims to identify psychological well-being and psychological distress effects on college students’ mental health. Methods: A correlational study was designed involving a non-probabilistic 560 sample of students (446 women) aged 18 to 41 years (M = 19.6; SD = 1.68). An online self-report questionnaire was used including demographic, relational, academic, and health behaviors variables, and the measures: Mental Health Inventory; Satisfaction with Social Support Scale; Academic Life Satisfaction Scale; and Psychological Vulnerability Scale. Results: Regression analyses indicate that male students, dating, good academic performance, exercise, sleeping seven hours, satisfaction with social support, and academic life satisfaction were significant correlates (p < 0.05) of psychological well-being, with the last two having great weight in the model. Females, low income, aged 21–24 years, sleeping less than 6 h, moderate psychological vulnerability, and perception of vulnerability were significant (p < 0.05) negative effects of psychological distress. Conclusions: This study addresses the positive and negative effects of psychological well-being and distress in college students.

In the present, mental health has emerged as one of the most important yet neglected facets of a person's entire well-being. Though mental health chatbots are up and coming, there is still a need for a cost-effective, reliable, and interactive system. Stress and anxiety are two of the few factors that damage mental health. A person with mental health issues may suffer negative outcomes if sufficient care is not provided. Nowadays, with advancements in technology, one can use a computer to foretell the start of such mental health issues. Despite the fact that numerous academics have examined a range of methods for predicting depression, they frequently depend solely on the use of facial expressions, which, because they are subtle and small, can alter the performance of the model. Therefore, using more elements like textual analysis and emotion detection can help increase accuracy. In this study, a method for predicting mental health status using facial expression and sentiment analysis results is introduced. Through emotion detection and text data characterising the user's mood, the suggested system replicates a one-on-one conversation between the user and the chatbot. Emotional detection and textual analysis are two features that can help predict mental health states more accurately. The suggested chatbot uses cutting-edge technology to analyse the user's mood using a variety of inputs and offer suggestions for managing the feeling. © 2024 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

For students, psychological health is critical since it affects their general health, academic performance, and chances for the future. A person’s subjective perception of positive psychological feelings, such as enjoyment, life fulfilment, and a sense of purpose, is referred to as psychological well-being. It is a comprehensive theory that takes into account several aspects of an individual’s mental and emotional well-being, such as fulfilling relationships, personal development, positive self-esteem and acceptance, and a sense of control over one’s life. The outdated and embarrassing education assessment system in higher educational institutions is just as accountable for students’ high levels of stress as their own aspirations and their parents’ expectations. Students’ memorization and ability to repeat information verbatim are frequently put to the test. Good scores are guaranteed by memorization of solutions to problems asked. Skills like analysis, knowledge application, problem solving, and creativity are rarely evaluated. Rajesh et al. (2022) Resources and techniques for stress management first should be made available through educational institutions and various support networks to the students. This can include time management sessions, mental health awareness campaigns, counselling support and fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.

The effect of MBIs delivered digitally to a broad range of university students and study attrition rates remain unclear. This review aimed to explore the effectiveness of online MBIs on university students’ mental health, academic performance and attrition rate of online MBIs. Four databases were searched; both randomised and non-randomised controlled trials were included. Outcomes included mental health-related outcomes and academic performance. Twenty-six studies were identified with outcomes related to mental health. When compared with non-active controls, small to medium statistically significant effect sizes in favour of online MBIs were found for depression, stress, anxiety, psychological distress and psychological well-being at post-intervention. However, these benefits were not seen when online MBIs were compared to active controls and other treatments at post-intervention or follow-up. University students in online MBI arms were more likely to drop out compared to non-active controls and active controls, but no differences were found compared to other treatments. Generally, the included studies’ risk of bias was moderate to high. Online MBIs appear beneficial for improving university students’ mental health when compared to non-active controls post-intervention, but not active controls or other treatments. Findings related to active controls and other treatments should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies, the small number of participants in included studies and the degree of heterogeneity in effect sizes. © The Author(s) 2023.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The preterm brain is in a period of extreme vulnerability and fundamental development during hospitalisation in the neonatal intensive care unit. Complications of prematurity cause both direct injury to the preterm brain (e.g., white matter lesions, intraventricular haemorrhage) and altered qualitative and quantitative development of white and grey matter (dysmaturation). Nutrition plays an important role in the neurodevelopment of the preterm infant and the aim of this paper is to summarise the latest evidence on the relationship between nutrition and neurodevelopmental outcomes. For the preterm, as well as for the full-term infant, human milk (HM) appears to be associated with better grey and white matter development at brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which then corresponds to better neurological outcomes in childhood (higher IQ and academic scores). In particular, HM components such as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) and Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) appear to play a key role in mediating this influence. As HM nutritional content is insufficient to meet the nutritional needs of most preterm infants, the use of multicomponent fortifiers derived from cow's milk has entered common practice in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Although there are promising results concerning the beneficial effects of HM fortifiers on auxological growth, data concerning the effects on neurodevelopment are still uncertain. In the absence of HM, formulas enriched of nutrients such as LCPUFA, HMOs, and sphingomyelin can make the formula more similar to breast milk and has been associated with improved myelination. Higher nutritional intakes of calories and lipids appear to be associated with fewer severe brain lesions and better maturation of white and grey matter. Prebiotics and postbiotics have been extensively studied in recent years for their beneficial effects on the gut and systemic level. In particular through the gut-brain axis it seems that they can regulate the inflammatory response and oxidative stress, mechanisms responsible for neurological damage of preterm infants. Nevertheless, evidence is still lacking on this point. Eventually, current knowledge on the role of micronutrient supplementation (e.g,. iron, lutein, iodine), is still scarce. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms of action of different nutrients on brain development in the preterm infant and thus the effects on long-term neurological outcomes.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

University life presents a unique set of stressors that may influence weight management alongside sleep quality. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate the association between overweight or obesity, stress, and sleep quality in a large sample of Greek university students. Materials and Methods: The study recruited 2116 active students from across various Greek universities. Participants completed questionnaires on sociodemographics, academic performance, and physical activity levels using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Stress and sleep quality were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Body weight and height were directly measured to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI). Results: Our analysis of 2116 Greek university students revealed significant associations between various factors and overweight/obesity. Compared to their rural counterparts, young adults in urban areas had an 88% higher prevalence of overweight/obesity (p = 0.0056). Regular smokers were twice as likely to be overweight or obese (p = 0.0012). Notably, those with low physical activity levels displayed a more than two-fold increased risk (p = 0.0008) compared to those with moderate or high activity levels. Similarly, students with moderate or high perceived stress levels had a more than two-fold prevalence of overweight/obesity compared to those with low stress (p = 0.0005). Inadequate sleep quality was also associated with an 86% higher risk of overweight/obesity (p = 0.0007). Interestingly, good academic performance showed a 57% greater prevalence of overweight/obesity compared to very good/excellent performance (p = 0.0103). Conclusions: Our findings reveal that perceived stress and poor sleep quality are significant risk factors for overweight and obesity in this young adult population. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, conventional clustering methods experience challenges with large datasets and complex issues, such as converging to local optima and sensitivity to initial random states. To address these limitations, this research work introduces an Improved Grey Wolf Clustering Algorithm (iGWCA). This improved approach aims to adjust the convergence rate and mitigate the risk of being trapped in local optima. The iGWCA algorithm provides a balanced technique for exploration and exploitation phases, alongside a local search mechanism around the optimal solution. To assess its efficiency, the proposed algorithm is verified on two different datasets. The dataset-I comprises 1100 individuals obtained from the Kaggle database, while dataset-II is based on 824 individuals obtained from the Mendeley database. The results demonstrate the competence of iGWCA in classifying student stress levels. The algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of lower intra-cluster distances, obtaining a reduction rate of 1.48% compared to Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), 8.69% compared to Mayfly Optimization (MOA), 8.45% compared to the Firefly Algorithm (FFO), 2.45% Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), 3.65%, Hybrid Sine Cosine with Cuckoo search (HSCCS), 8.20%, Hybrid Firefly and Genetic Algorithm (FAGA) and 8.68% Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in minimizing intra-cluster distances, making it a better choice for student stress classification. This research contributes to the advancement of understanding and managing student well-being within academic communities by providing a robust tool for stress level classification. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Among the various factors that can impact students’ wellbeing, the physical environment can potentially restore cognitive, physiological, and emotional resources, thereby enhancing academic performance, and overall quality of life, while reducing feelings of stress and depression. The Perceived Restorativeness Scale is the most commonly used tool to assess the level of restorativeness derived from the educational physical environment. However, a tailored measure could be a more psychometrically suitable approach to capture the context-specific characteristics of university environments for academic students. This study aimed to validate an instrument that can accurately evaluate university spaces to measure the perceived restorativeness of university students. A total sample of 685 students from two Italian universities participated in the evaluation of the psychometric properties of the Restorativeness at University scale (Rest@US), consisting of 13 items divided into four dimensions: fascination, being-away, scope, and coherence. The hypothesised four-factor model (being-away, fascination, scope, and coherence) demonstrated excellent fit indices in both the calibration and validation samples and was invariant for sex. The scale demonstrates good reliability. Furthermore, criterion validity has been confirmed, highlighting that, in a theoretically consistent manner, the perceived restorativeness of university physical environments from the point of view of students and its dimensions were negatively correlated with techno-overload and study-related workload and positively correlated with perceived performance and psycho-physical wellbeing.

Although society worldwide was affected, students and the academic sector were hit hardest. Distance learning was used by almost all governments globally during the pandemic to keep education going when schools were closed. Lockdown, maintaining social distance, online classes, financial insecurity of the parents, etc., have tremendous impacts on students’ academic performance and mental health. The primary aim of this article is to review the existing literature to explore how COVID-19 affects students’ academic performance and poses a threat to their mental health. We reviewed 88 articles published between 2020 and 2023 and found that students from low-income backgrounds face disproportionate educational barriers. Converting from face-to-face to online classes was not equally smooth for students from all backgrounds. We also found that various life circumstances negatively affected students' mental health, including concerns about contracting a disease, financial difficulties, isolation from peers, the death of a parent, and the transition to online education. Worry, despair, and stress have all reached potentially lethal heights due to COVID-19 among students. Geographical disparities in the impacts of COVID-19 were seen, with certain nations seeing a greater degree of influence, particularly in the realm of education.

Students self-reported their academic grading (AG) and perceptions about their academic performance. Spearman’s rho and multiple logistic regression models were used. Almost half (47%) experienced some level of FI. The median AG was 95. AG was not significantly (p > 0.05) correlated with FI, nor with depression, anxiety, stress, and SQ. Considering mental health and SQ, moderate/severe FI remained significantly associated with perceived overall progress in college (OR: 2.96; 95%CI: 1.49, 5.88) and attendance to classes (OR:3.14; 95%CI: 1.19, 8.28) as poor or regular, and it was positively related to perceiving difficulties in completing their studies (OR:2.75; 95%CI: 1.43, 5.29). Stress, anxiety, depression symptoms, and poor SQ were also significantly associated with poor/regular perception of academic performance.

The research questions asked are: 1. To what degree does students’ schoolwork stress vary between academic classes?; And 2. are perceptions of classroom goal orientation, academic achievement, sex and parental education related to schoolwork stress? Methods: A cross-sectional survey was done in the final year of upper secondary school in 71 school classes from 13 schools. A total of 1955 students in academic education programs were invited to participate in the survey, and 1511 completed the survey; the response rate was 77%. The outcome measure was a composite measure of schoolwork stress (alpha = 0.81). Multilevel modeling was used to estimate school class-level effects. Results: The mean value of schoolwork stress was 4.0, on a scale of 1 (very little schoolwork stress) to 6 (very high schoolwork stress). About half of the students reported a score of 4 or higher. The analysis showed that individual characteristics explained most of the variation in schoolwork stress. Girls experienced a much higher level of schoolwork stress than boys (mean values of 4.3 and 3.6, respectively). There was also a significant class-level effect, estimated to 6% of the variance. Students’ perceptions of classroom goal orientation was also associated with schoolwork stress. Conclusions: The main contribution was the discovery of significant variations in schoolwork stress between school classes. We also found that higher mastery climate was linked to lower schoolwork stress, whereas higher performance climate was linked to higher schoolwork stress. © Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Using a cross-sectional survey design, a sample of 1,200 third-and fourth-year students from twenty-four universities across Nigeria was selected through a multistage sampling procedure. Contrary to peer pressure, family expectations, financial constraints, and cultural norms significantly influenced students' academics and overall well-being. The study highlighted social interactions and societal pressures contributing to overall stress levels. Coping mechanisms included relaxation techniques and seeking support from friends, while exercise, professional advice, or counseling were less utilized. Binary logistic regression showed no significant associations between coping mechanisms, gender, age groups, and academic achievement. Gender did not significantly influence stressor prevalence. The study identified significant variations in familial and social stressors across different age groups among Nigerian university students. These findings provide insights into student challenges, informing strategies for enhanced well-being and academic success. Recommendations include raising awareness about family expectations, providing financial literacy education, promoting cultural sensitivity, and offering mental health support. The study emphasizes gender-neutral services, longitudinal research, peer mentoring programs, and institutional collaboration to address the multifaceted challenges faced by Nigerian students. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

Yet, despite this increased attention, research related to anxiety disorders in Saudi Arabia remain limited. This study aims to address this gap by assessing the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as well as explore its association with students’ sociodemographic factors and academic performance among medical students in a Saudi Arabian institute that has a diverse, multicultural student body. Methods: The study takes place in a unique educational environment: a privately funded institute in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with 32% of its student body comprising international students from over 40 countries, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study deploys the use of a survey that was sent to the students at this institute via their institutional emails. A survey containing 33 items assessing demographics, GAD using GAD-7 questionnaire, stress-relief measures, online learning experience during the pandemic, mental disorders, anxiety associated with the pandemic, two open-ended questions, and one item assessing sleep difficulty. Results: The results of the survey showed that a significant majority of the responders’ scores in the GAD-7 assessment were in the range of moderate to severe anxiety. The results also suggest that low cGPA and the first academic years are significantly associated with higher GAD-7 scores. Students found severe time constraints, difficult educational content, and lack of psychological support to be major sources of stress. Furthermore, students suggested providing an in-house psychologist, personalized feedback, and guidance on study tactics as methods to reduce anxiety. Conclusion: These findings, among others, suggest a need for further studies and research in this field to uncover broader patterns and inform targeted mental health support strategies.

Despite numerous studies on this preventable cause of death, the focus has primarily been on single nations and traditional statistical methods. Objective: This study aims to develop a predictive model for adolescent suicidal thinking using multinational data sets and machine learning (ML). Methods: We used data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey with 566, 875 adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years and conducted external validation using the Youth Risk Behavior Survey with 103, 874 adolescents and Norway's University National General Survey with 19, 574 adolescents. Several tree-based ML models were developed, and feature importance and Shapley additive explanations values were analyzed to identify risk factors for adolescent suicidal thinking. Results: When trained on the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey data from South Korea with a 95% CI, the XGBoost model reported an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 90.06% (95% CI 89.97-90.16), displaying superior performance compared to other models. For external validation using the Youth Risk Behavior Survey data from the United States and the University National General Survey from Norway, the XGBoost model achieved AUROCs of 83.09% and 81.27%, respectively. Across all data sets, XGBoost consistently outperformed the other models with the highest AUROC score, and was selected as the optimal model. In terms of predictors of suicidal thinking, feelings of sadness and despair were the most influential, accounting for 57.4% of the impact, followed by stress status at 19.8%. This was followed by age (5.7%), household income (4%), academic achievement (3.4%), sex (2.1%), and others, which contributed less than 2% each. Conclusions: This study used ML by integrating diverse data sets from 3 countries to address adolescent suicide. The findings highlight the important role of emotional health indicators in predicting suicidal thinking among adolescents. Specifically, sadness and despair were identified as the most significant predictors, followed by stressful conditions and age. These findings emphasize the critical need for early diagnosis and prevention of mental health issues during adolescence. © Hyejun Kim, Yejun Son, Hojae Lee, Jiseung Kang, Ahmed Hammoodi, Yujin Choi, Hyeon Jin Kim, Hayeon Lee, Guillaume Fond, Laurent Boyer, Rosie Kwon, Selin Woo, Dong Keon Yon.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

First, the conceptualization of integrating character strengths and mindfulness into MBSP is discussed. The literature on the interrelatedness of character strengths and mindfulness is then described, along with ways that the intervention of MBSP encourages positive outcomes at various levels. The literature search returned 7 (10 samples, N = 3,851) studies supporting a positive association between character strengths and mindfulness (r = 0.3–0.4) and the mediating role of character strengths/virtues in mindfulness and mindfulness’s role in enhancing character strengths toward psychological well-being. The nine MBSP intervention studies (9 samples, N = 354) conducted in diverse contexts provide evidence of a significant improvement in well-being, engagement, life satisfaction, mindfulness, positive affect, character strengths, work-related outcomes, heightened birthing parents’ well-being during pregnancy and childbirth, increased academic performance, and enhanced mental health among students. The intervention studies also reported the fostering of mindful positive parenting and contributions to a significant reduction in negative psychological states, such as stress, depression, anxiety, and negative affect. This comprehensive review provides empirical support for the MBSP framework and its positive impact on well-being across various domains, including organizations, education, healthcare, and family. However, it underscores the need for more extensive research, as the current literature on MBSP is limited. The review encourages future studies to explore MBSP applications in diverse domains, thereby paving the way for a deeper understanding of its potential benefits. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

They experience a wide range of challenges while studying abroad that have an impact on their psychological well-being. These challenges can include language obstacles, cultural differences, homesickness, financial issues and other elements that could severely impact the mental health of international students. Given the limited research on the demographic, cultural, and psychosocial variables that influence international students' mental health, and the scarcity of studies on the use of machine learning algorithms in this area, this study aimed to analyse data to understand the demographic, cultural factors, and psychosocial factors that impact mental health of international students. Additionally, this paper aimed to build a machine learningbased model for predicting depression among international students in the United Kingdom. This study utilized both primary data gathered through an online survey questionnaire targeted at international students and secondary data was sourced from the 'A Dataset of Students' Mental Health and Help-Seeking Behaviors in a Multicultural Environment,' focusing exclusively on international student data within this dataset. We conducted data analysis on the primary data and constructed models using the secondary data for predicting depression among international students. The secondary dataset is divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets for analysis, employing four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K Nearest Neighbor. To assess each algorithm's performance, we considered metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision and AU-ROC curve. This study identifies significant demographic variables (e.g., loan status, gender, age, marital status) and psychosocial factors (financial difficulties, academic stress, homesickness, loneliness) contributing to international students' mental health. Among the machine learning models, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving an 80% accuracy rate in predicting depression.  © 2024 Rahman, Kohli.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship of daily stress, Bedtime procrastination (BP) (i.e., postponing bedtime without external reasons), and sleep outcomes controlling for trait factors such as self-control. N = 96 students at a German university (M = 22.2 years, SD = 4.0) wore a sleep-tracking wearable (Fitbit Charge HR) for two weeks to assess sleep duration and to calculate the gap between the intended time to go to sleep and the objectively measured time of falling asleep. Stress, intended time to go to sleep, and sleep quality were assessed via daily diaries. Established questionnaires were used to measure trait self-control, trait BP, and smartphone addiction. Multilevel analyses indicated that more stress experienced during the day was associated with more BP (b = 2.32, p = 0.008), shorter sleep duration (b = −3.46, p = 0.003), and lower sleep quality (b = 1.03, p = 0.005) after controlling for several trait factors. The association of daily stress with sleep outcomes (quality and duration) was partly mediated by BP. Our findings indicate that BP might be one factor that contributes to stress-linked decreases in sleep duration and quality. Potential reasons for stress-related later time to fall asleep—like higher physiological arousal or stress-related worries—should be investigated in future studies. © 2023 The Authors.

Although digital technologies have proven beneficial in language learning, their excessive use has led to digital burnout among students. This systematic review analyzes the existing research regarding digital burnout in SLA, exploring symptoms, consequences, and coping strategies. Digital burnout has various symptoms, such as decreased motivation and performance, mental fatigue, and physical health problems. Some of the bad effects are low linguistic development, diminished engagement, and negative emotional responses. The review also suggests strategies to avoid digital burnout, such as establishing sound study plans, prioritizing self-care, and establishing clear boundaries between academic and personal physical areas. As a reverse trend, simplicity in SLA with more realtime learning and balanced digitalization should be encouraged, as it brings focus, clarity, and less stress to our lives, creating more time and freedom for personal pursuits and promoting self-sustainability. © 2023, IGI Global.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

Health care students are at particular risk of stress and exposure to adverse events, negatively affecting well-being and performance and leading to increased attrition. Academic resilience has been identified as one factor helping mitigate such negative effects in students. Despite this, there is limited research exploring the topic in pharmacy education. Methods. Using a cross-sectional survey design, students attending three schools of pharmacy in the United Kingdom (N=1161) completed psychometric measures of academic resilience and well-being. Comparative, correlational, and regression analyses were conducted, exploring the relationship between academic resilience and well-being. Results. Academic resilience and well-being were significantly lower in pharmacy students compared to other student populations. Academic resilience was a positive correlate and predictor for well-being. Academic resilience was highest in first-year students, declined over subsequent years of study, and varied by pharmacy school and gender but not ethnicity. Conclusion. Introducing and embedding strategies to enhance academic resilience in pharmacy education may improve well-being and performance and reduce attrition. © 2023 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Simultaneously, however, qualitative studies consistently find that high-performing students and students attending high-performing schools report high levels of stress and other mental health problems. This study investigates a simple explanation for this puzzle–that the relationship between performance and mental health is not linear and is conditional on the performance culture of the school. Data on almost 5000 Swedish students from the Programme for International Student Assessment were used. The results show that the relationship between performance and mental health is generally not linear and that intermediate-performing boys have the best mental health, while both low- and high-performing girls and boys alike have poorer mental health. Although inconclusive, the results also suggest that low-performing students may be vulnerable to a strong school performance culture. © 2023 The Author(s).

All the previous studies demonstrated benefits of napping, meditation, relaxation, and sharing feelings and experiences on students’ mental well-being, which could enrich the brain’s educational capacity, a matter that is relevant to a student’s learning level. This study aimed to encourage on-campus students to alleviate their feelings and relax. This process will help students to recharge their energy, in addition to increasing their alertness and focusing abilities, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified global stresses. In this study, the authors used a systematic review and literature analysis to understand the relationship between mental stresses and student performance. We then used an evidence-based research opinion poll and presented our work at different academic exhibitions for feedback as an approach for developing an experimental conceptual multi-activity unit that can be used across university campuses. The “Reviving Pod” was specifically designed for different activities: napping, meditation, and virtual communication. The designed approach utilizes state-of-the-art technologies (embedded sensors, smart ergonomic seats, contactless technologies, self-cleaning materials, IoT, virtual meetings platforms, mobile applications, etc.). A Reviving Pod can be located variably within a university campus. According to the poll results, we proposed a recreational zone design to accommodate the pods, as well as a diversity of activities that can encourage students to relieve their stresses and reinforce their health, consequently increasing their academic performance and supporting their well-being using the WELL Building Standard to promote better mental health, which is vital for students’ success. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This is linked to extrinsic causes like academics, family, and friends. However, previous studies have shown low rates of students seeking professional psychological help for their problems. This study investigate the relationship among factors including academic performance, educational stress, peer pressure and openness to seeking professional psychological help. We conducted this study with 471 high school students (grades 10-12) engaged. The questionnaire was based on three measurements: peer pressure short form (PPSF), educational stress scale for adolescents (ESSA), and openness to seeking professional psychological help (ATSPPH_O). The Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and The PLS-SEM method were used to evaluate this research. The results showed that: (i) students with a higher level of peer pressure have a greater openness to seeking professional psychological help; (ii) the more open to seeking professional psychological help, the higher educational stress that students got; (iii) students with a higher level of peer pressure have greater educational stress; (iv) the openness to seeking professional psychological help would mediate the relationship between peer pressure and educational stress; (v) there was a significant difference between academic performance of peer pressure. On the one hand, counselors, clinicians, and therapists must identify students who are experiencing educational stress in the context of peer pressure as vulnerable groups in need of early mental health interventions. On the other hand, educators and teachers must consider the impact of peer pressure on students' academic performance and devise appropriate teaching strategies. © 2024 Sciedu Press.

Occupational performance coaching is an action-oriented and strengths-based approach that can help clients set and accomplish personally valued goals. We carried out a pilot project to evaluate a tele-rehabilitation occupational performance coaching service for university students within an occupational therapy fieldwork placement. Method: A pretest post-test design was used. Severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress and goal achievement were measured before and after the intervention and semi-structured interviews were carried out with student clients and student therapists. Development of student therapist competencies were noted. Results: Thirty-five student clients enrolled in occupational performance coaching and participated in 1–6 sessions. They identified academic, health, social and vocational goals. Through occupational performance coaching, clients made important progress on their goals. Following occupational performance coaching, clients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in anxiety and depression. The occupational therapy students attained competencies comparable in number and level to those achieved in more traditional placements. Conclusion: Occupational performance coaching is a potentially valuable addition to student mental health services. Such a service can be provided by supervised fieldwork students. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Students who are subjected to psychological stress have often been reported to have lower sleep quality which together has affected the academic performance of the students. Objective: While stress has its adverse effect on students'quality of sleep, an effort is also made to identify standard techniques and tools to automatically assess stress levels and sleep quality in a non-invasive environment among students only. This article mainly focuses on the Clinical and technical methodology employed in stress level detection and sleep quality prediction among students. Methods: This study was conducted by examining all research studies conducted in the past with respect to students in an academic setting from year 2000 to early 2022. The papers under study where finalised based on different methodologies involved in stress level detection and sleep quality prediction considering both in unimodal and multimodal measurements. Results: While questionnaires and physiological signals are used as a standard measuring tool, it is mostly used in a unimodal environment to measure students’ mental stress or sleep quality in academic settings. Conclusion: This paper describes in detail the clinical aspect of the association between mental stress, sleep quality, and academic performance in students followed by technical aspects to analyse the stress levels and sleep quality both qualitatively and quantitatively in an academic environment. © 2023","Review","Final","","Scopus"

This study examines the interplay between smartphone dependence (SPD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and various mental health outcomes among Korean adolescents. Data from the 16th Adolescence Health Behavior Survey (2020), including 54,948 middle and high school students, were analyzed. Adolescents were categorized into three groups based on SPD severity. The GAD-7 scale assessed anxiety, and other factors such as subjective health recognition, happiness, weight control efforts, and body mass index (BMI) were considered. Adolescents with higher SPD exhibited lower academic performance, decreased happiness, and increased perception of stress. GAD levels were positively correlated with SPD, with higher SPD linked to more severe GAD symptoms. Additionally, higher SPD was associated with increased loneliness, sadness, and suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts as well as a greater likelihood of habitual drug use. Gender differences revealed that females were more prone to sadness, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts, while males exhibited higher rates of drug use. This study highlights the complex relationship between SPD, GAD, and mental health outcomes among Korean adolescents. Stress recognition was found to mediate the association between GAD and SPD. The process-macro result of the total effect between SPD on GAD and the direct effect of the SPD pathway on GAD was significant; thus, the stress recognition was mediated.

Our objective was to determine the degree of trainee teachers’ emotional exhaustion and associated variables during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: the design was cross-sectional and descriptive. Questionnaires with sociodemographic variables, perceptions of mental health, and the Emotional Exhaustion Scale (ECE) (α = 0.890; ω = 0.893) validated for the Chilean context were answered by 204 trainee teachers. The results were analyzed using SPSS software version 25 and the Emotional Exhaustion Interpretation Table (EES-Int). Results: the results show that 92.2% of the trainee teachers presented a worsening in their mental health, stress (66.2%), irritability (38.2%), anxiety (37.7%), and depressive symptoms (32.8%). Online classes (73.04%) and the pandemic (67.6%) were the main influencing factors. Education students who perceived their mental health had worsened became 6.63 times more likely to develop emotional exhaustion [AOR = 6.63; 95% CI: 1.78, 24.69]. In addition, education students with a high perception of academic stress were 7.45 more likely to develop emotional exhaustion [AOR = 7.45; 95% CI: 1.98, 28.09]. Conclusion: we can conclude that trainee teachers have high levels of emotional exhaustion and their perception of their mental health and the academic stress they are being subjected to during the COVID-19 pandemic may lead them to present symptoms of frequent or permanent problems with concentration, attention, recall of information, dissatisfaction with their performance, and frequent learning difficulties. From the affective dimension, they present frequent or permanent anxiety, restlessness, irritability, indifference, low mood, and psychomatization. From the socio-interactional dimension, they present frequent or permanent social withdrawal, interpersonal problems, problems at work or school, and family and relationship problems. Increasing the sample to delve into emotional exhaustion by subject area is necessary. For future studies, research should be conducted on the causes of emotional exhaustion by subject area and the coping strategies of trainee teachers to understand differences and provide input on emotional support in practice. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Empathy has been reported to be connected with coping. This study wanted to explore the most used coping strategies and whether gender differences existed, and to investigate whether and to what extent empathy affected coping in a sample of pre-clinical medical students. In a cross-sectional study design, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and the Coping Orientations to the Problems Experienced - New Italian Version (COPE-NIV) were administered to 398 (53% females) Italian second-year medical students. T-tests and multiple regression analyses were used to explore gender differences and the association between IRI and COPE-NIV scores, respectively. Problem Orientation obtained the highest mean score, whereas Avoidance the lowest one. Females outscored males on Social Support (t = 4.95, p <.001) and Transcendent Orientation (t = 4.04, p <.001). After controlling for gender, Empathic Concern was positively associated with Social Support (β = 0.223, p =.001) and Transcendent Orientation (β = 0.234, p =.001). Perspective Taking was positively and negatively associated with Positive Attitude (β = 0.248, p <.001) and Transcendent Orientation (β = − 0.180, p =.008), respectively. Personal Distress was negatively related to Problem Orientation (β = − 0.250, p <.001). Educational and psychological counselling interventions targeting empathy should be implemented in the pre-clinical years to equip medical students to cope functionally with the emotional distress linked to medical school. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

In fact, fasting is a common practice in different religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. During the month of Ramadan, more than 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide fast from dawn to sunset. Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) has health benefits, including a reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and an improvement in mood. However, little is known about the effects of RDIF on lifestyle behaviors, such as regular exercise, consuming healthy diet, and avoiding harmful substances, as well as mental stress, and academic performance in high school and university students. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, two self-reported questionnaires were sent one week before and during the last week of Ramadan (April 2022; Ramadan 1443 in Hijri Islamic Calendar) to assess changes in lifestyle, perceived stress, and academic achievement of medical students at Taif University in Taif city, Saudi Arabia. Healthy lifestyle components data were collected to calculate healthy lifestyle scores, including body mass index, physical activity, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, smoking status, and sleep duration. Results: RDIF was associated with a healthier lifestyle in both female and male participants (pre-RDIF mean score: 2.42 vs post-RDIF mean score: 2.74; statistical power = 0.99; P-value < 0.05). They were more active and adherent to the Mediterranean diet during RDIF. Additionally, the post-RDIF smoking rate declined by 53.4%. Male participants showed higher perceived stress scores during RDIF (pre-RDIF mean score: 19.52 vs post-RDIF mean score: 22.05; P-value < 0.01). No changes in academic performance were observed upon RDIF. Conclusion: Medical students show healthier dietary and lifestyle behaviors and their academic performance is not affected during RDIF. However, perceived stress is higher among male students. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The paper discusses many effective methods and techniques for correcting and preventing stress that are simple to learn and practice. They give good results in working with children, adolescents, and youths in training and education. Some practices are more complex and require more attention and effort to understand and master them, but they also have broader capabilities in various situations. Therefore, training sessions aimed at training in the prevention and correction of (di)stress conditions are very relevant and necessary. The results showed that there is a conscious and urgent need for students to reduce anxiety and stress, including ways to deal with learning stresses. Stress management can and should be structured and systematically organized, including in the instrumental sense: students need to be taught how to manage stress and themselves, increase their resistance to stress (resilience), and be trained to use different coping techniques with anxiety, as appropriate. In an empirical study, representatives of other groups of students from three Kazakh universities answered questions from three author's stress questionnaires. According to the respondents, the study results showed that students need knowledge about stress. The study showed the urgent need for special educational and training seminars, lectures, and even courses on (di)stress and physical, mental, and moral injuries and coping with them. Such classes are needed to help schoolchildren and students cope with stress and avoid problems with moral, mental, and physical health to prevent other negative consequences of school and related strains. © 2023 by the author.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Conversely, stressful academic environments can contribute to mental health issues, highlighting the responsibility of educational institutions in providing an environment conducive to the holistic well-being of their students. The importance of training and raising awareness among academic and administrative staff for early detection and appropriate response to mental health issues was emphasized. Multifaceted interventions that address both mental well-being and academic performance were found to be particularly effective.

Nevertheless, the scientific literature on the experiences of South Asian students is lacking, where often studies focused on Asian Americans exclude South Asians altogether. South Asian students have unique experiences in California higher education, often having to cope with high pressure to perform academically and various social responsibilities associated with being first-, second-, or third-generation American. Many South Asian countries have been more severely affected by COVID-19 due to the density of people living in close proximity to one another. Students of South Asian origin worry for their families overseas, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted populations there to a more considerable extent. Methodology: This was a qualitative research study conducted using in-depth interviews with 25 students who identified as South Asian and were currently enrolled in higher education in California at the time they were interviewed. Ads were placed on social media networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, and participation in the study was voluntary. Students were chosen randomly to avoid bias. Study participants described their experiences navigating higher education throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in relation to their social, economic, cultural, and political spheres. Interviews were mainly conducted through Zoom, some through emails or phone calls. All participants will remain anonymous to protect the identities of students. This project sought to understand the experiences of South Asian students as they navigate the new normal amidst a global crisis. Qualitative responses were indexed by themes, with South Asian students reporting a relationship between the pandemic and worsened academic experiences, issues of exacerbated mental health, the spread of misinformation, and increased religious tensions. This research reflects pragmatism, and the findings of this paper are coupled with suggested recommendations to ameliorate pandemic related issues for future South Asian students. The project was conducted through both inductive and qualitative approaches. The research strategy is action research, and the research was meant to shine a light on issues South Asian students face and help university administrations understand how to better support students during a pandemic. The time horizon is cross-sectional. The research focuses on COVID-19 in relation to South Asian students’ performance and health. At 25 participants, data saturation was reached. Further participants were not needed as the qualitative research data was sufficient to draw conclusions from. The research was deemed to pose no risk to students; therefore, approval from an ethical committee was not sought. All participants signed consent forms in order to participate. Follow-up interviews were conducted to address students’ experiences with family in India experiencing the B.167.2 variant and the transition back to in-person learning following virtual schooling. Conclusions/significance: South Asian students in higher education bear a unique set of responsibilities in addition to the already rigorous coursework associated with college. However, the stresses and health of South Asian students often go understudied or overlooked. This research serves to begin to fill in the gaps in literature of South Asian experiences in higher education. The pandemic posed additional challenges for students, who lost access to their campus communities with university education going virtual, and many South Asian students had to move back home. Through this qualitative research study analyzing the experiences of South Asians enrolled in California higher education, it can be concluded that there is a relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and students’ academic performance, mental health, as well as an increase in the amount of misinformation spread regarding COVID-19 public safety guidelines. © 2023 The Author","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This topic involves the investigation and analysis of the dual effect of private tutoring. By using China Education Panel Survey data for 2014 and 2015, this study consistently finds that although investing time in private tutoring can boost academic achievement, it has a significant negative impact on students’ mental health. With an increase in average time spent and proportional participation in tutoring at the class level, the positive effect of the time invested in after-school tutoring on academic performance continues to weaken while the negative impact on mental health is gradually enhanced for a given individual. The main triggers for the worsening of mental health are the weakening of the social comparison effect as well as the enhancement of the role stress effect and the sleep deprivation effect. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Boxing as a form of exercise has been shown to have mental health benefits in adults. Methods: This study investigated the impact of boxing exercise with a virtual reality (VR) game vs. with a guided video on anxiety, stress, and executive function in adolescents. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts: Oculus Rift BOXVR game (n = 14), boxing with a guided workout video (n = 14), or a non-intervention control (n = 14). The BOXVR and guided video groups participated in 10-minute exercise sessions, 5 times a week for 3 weeks. Results: The groups were comparable at baseline on all outcomes. Only BOXVR participants exhibited a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in stress and significant improvements on the Trail Making Test (TMT) B at weekly checkpoints and follow up. All cohorts showed improvements in executive function on the TMT A. At the end of the study, the BOXVR group reported significantly lower stress levels than the guided video group, and significantly better TMT A & B scores than the control group. Only the control group showed a significant reduction in anxiety but the groups were not significantly different in anxiety at the end of the study. The BOXVR group reported significantly greater enjoyment after each exercise session than the guided video group. Conclusion: BOXVR was shown to be effective in reducing adolescent stress and improving executive function over a three-week period. While larger studies with real-life functional outcomes are necessary, boxing with an immersive VR game represents a potential non-pharmaceutical mode to reduce stress in adolescents that is easy to implement in school settings.  © Copyright 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Their mental health influences many aspects in their life as they go through many physical and emotional changes. Adolescent mental health is harmed by changes in emotional and physical state, as well as increased academic pressure. This study aimed to assess academic stress and its associated factors among adolescents in rural Nepal. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 424 adolescents residing in Karnali Province, Nepal. Academic stress was measured using Student Assessing Academic Stress. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine associated factors at the significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Of the total students, 19.8% had moderate academic stress and 2.4% of them had high academic stress. Female students had thrice higher odds of having academic stress as compared to male students (Adjusted Odds Ratio:3.47; 95% Confidence Interval:1.91to 6.31, p-value:<0.001). Grade 10 students had higher odds of having academic stress as compared to grade 9 (Adjusted Odds Ratio:2.02; 95% Confidence Interval:1.13 to 3.61, p-value:0.017). Students of literate mothers were more likely to experience academic stress than those with illiterate mothers (Adjusted Odds Ratio:0.53; 95% Confidence Interval:0.29 to 0.96, p-value:0.036). Students with unsatisfactory academic performance had thrice higher odds of having academic stress as compared to students with satisfactory academic performance (Adjusted Odds Ratio:3.12; 95% Confidence Interval:1.46 to 6.67, p-value:<0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study showed that high school students have academic stress, which is related to many factors at home and school. Understanding academic stress and parents and teachers providing the best support to the students could help lessen the burden.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Aims: To investigate previous and current mental health issues, significant sources of stress, burnout, and substance use among medical students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Method: We conducted an online survey to collect data on demographics, sources of stress, mental health problems, burnout, and substance use in 385 medical students from the UAE University. We used the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12), and the CAGE questionnaire. Results: Our results indicated that 5.7% of participants had been diagnosed with a mental health condition prior to joining medical school, and that 21.6% of participants were diagnosed with a mental illness while in medical school.

However, there is little work on the detection of stress and anxiety in academic settings and/or its impact on the performance of undergraduate students. Moreover, there is a gap in the literature in terms of identifying any computing, information technologies, or technological platforms that help educational institutions to identify students with mental health problems. This paper aims to systematically review the literature to identify the advances, limitations, challenges, and possible lines of research for detecting academic stress and anxiety in the classroom. Forty-four recent articles on the topic of detecting stress and anxiety in academic settings were analyzed. The results show that the main tools used for detecting anxiety and stress are psychological instruments such as self-questionnaires. The second most used method is acquiring and analyzing biological signals and biomarkers using commercial measurement instruments. Data analysis is mainly performed using descriptive statistical tools and pattern recognition techniques. Specifically, physiological signals are combined with classification algorithms. The results of this method for detecting anxiety and academic stress in students are encouraging. Using physiological signals reduces some of the limitations of psychological instruments, such as response time and self-report bias. Finally, the main challenge in the detection of academic anxiety and stress is to bring detection systems into the classroom. Doing so, requires the use of non-invasive sensors and wearable systems to reduce the intrinsic stress caused by instrumentation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Our cross-sectional study aimed to identify the prevalence of IBS and its impact on anxiety levels, quality of life, and academic performance among undergraduate students. Method: A total of 357 students (male and female) were randomly selected. IBS prevalence was assessed using Rome III criteria and Birmingham IBS Symptom Questionnaire. Anxiety and quality of life were measured using Beck Anxiety Inventory and IBS-Quality of Life Questionnaire respectively. Results: About 16% of students had IBS with the majority from medical departments. Females had a higher IBS prevalence due to diet, lifestyle, and cultural habits. Students with IBS showed high levels of anxiety, below-average quality of life, low academic performance, and insufficient knowledge of IBS. Interestingly, negative, and positive correlations (p =.000) were found between the demographic variables. However, the anxiety levels and quality of life were significantly correlated. Conclusion: Several factors, such as social characteristics, diet, and posttraumatic stress disorder caused by wars, are significantly correlated with IBS development, and could impact students' lives. Our findings can pave the way for creating preventive measures, including stress management and health education programs, to curb the incidence of IBS and anxiety among undergraduate students. Therefore, appropriate interventions are necessary to address the student’s mental health with IBS and improve their academic and personal lives. © 2019 ANGIOTHERAPY, a publication of Eman Research Ltd, Australia.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Self-esteem is recognized as an indicator of a person’s mental health, with lower levels associated with mental conditions such as stress and depression. In the context of nursing education, self-esteem has been linked to student’s academic performance, clinical competence, and overall well-being. Existing literature suggests that self-esteem among student nurses varies across countries and cultures. Assessing the self-esteem level among student nurses is essential for identifying students at risk of experiencing academic difficulties or mental health problems. Objective: The study aimed to assess the self-esteem level among student nurses at Al-Majmaah University, Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed and conducted with 346 nursing students conveniently selected at Majmaah University in Saudi Arabia in May 2023. A self-reported questionnaire utilizing the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was employed. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics software, including descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. Results: The findings revealed that 265 students (76.6%) had moderate self-esteem levels, 53 students (15.3%) had low self-esteem, and 28 students (8.1%) had high levels of selfesteem. Examination of self-esteem in relation to socio-demographic variables resulted in statistically significant correlations with the year of study, physical health, psychological health, and father’s education (p <0.05). Conclusion: The study’s results offer valuable insights for nurse educators, which can serve as a compass for designing educational and awareness programs to boost self-esteem among student nurses. These initiatives hold significance in equipping students with the necessary attributes for their upcoming roles as professional nurses. Nonetheless, further investigations are warranted to delve into self-esteem and associated factors. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

It is a serious issue that may have negative effects on adolescents, including poor academic performance and mental health issues. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of bullying and assess its connection with the adolescents’ mental health and self-esteem. Methods: In a cross-sectional analysis, 340 students participated in the study, to determine what personal, familial, school, and social characteristics that are associated with bullying, a self-administered questionnaire was applied. The short form of the aggressiveness and victimization scale was used to measure bullying and victimization. Their emotional well-being was measured with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was used for self-esteem assessment. Results: The prevalence of bullying behavior was 71.2% and the victimization rate was 87.9%. Approximately 2.6% were unique bullies, 19.4% were unique victims, and 68.6% were bully victims. There were significant positive correlation between both bullying and victimization scores and each of depression, anxiety, and stress. Victimization score was negatively correlated with self-esteem. On logistic regression analysis, insulting words at home was a hazard factor for being a unique bully. While school punishment was a hazard factor for being both a unique victim and a bully-victim. Other hazard factors for being a bully-victim were students’ younger age, being in preparatory grade, and exposure to street violence. Conclusions: A high prevalence of bullying among secondary school adolescents was noted. A bullying prevention program should be designed and implemented in schools to control this problem. © 2023, Egyptian Community Medicine Association.

Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and worry and its relationship with the academic performance of medical students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Iran. Methods: In this descriptive-correlational research, 261 medical students participated in Iran. The standard Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Pennsylvania Standard Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) were used to collect data. Similarly, students’ grade point averages (GPAs) were considered an indicator of their academic performance. The statistical analysis was carried out using IBM’s Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 25.0. The level of statistical significance was reported at P < 0.05. Results: The prevalence of students’ worry, depression, anxiety, and stress (moderate to severe levels) was 93.5%, 75.1%, 71.6%, and 50.2%, respectively, revealing the tremendous negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students’ mental health. Likewise, there was an inverse relationship between students’ anxiety and GPAs. So with the increased anxiety, the students’ GPAs decreased. There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of worry, stress, depression, and anxiety among students and their employment, and it was found that employed students had better mental health. Conclusions: The students’ mental health was unfavorable, threatening their academic performance. The current research offers valuable information to parents, educators, and other stakeholders. Consequently, a combination of efforts by the government, universities, and families or communities is needed to reduce the harmful and destructive effects on students’ mental health. Indeed, the harmful consequences of this prolonged epidemic require further investigations in the future. © 2023, Jundishapur Journal of Chronic Disease Care.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The evaluation of the viewpoint of the dental teachers of the Faculty of Dentistry at “Carol Davila” University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest, Romania, on these exceptional circumstances’ consequences was the objective of this paper. A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2022, on the academic staff who reported their perceptions of the emotional and educational impact of the pandemic by completing a Google Forms questionnaire. Although a significant emotional impact of the pandemic was reported by over a third of the participants (31.2%), most of them being teachers of fifth-year dental students (p = 0.019), the perceived stress had an impact on the teaching performance in few of them (14%), the quality of sleep remaining unaffected in most of them (53.7%), whereas the level of anxiety was low (57%). An educational impact regarding the techno difficulties during the online transition was mentioned by few respondents (16.1%), with male teaching staff facing the fewest problems (p = 0.024), as well as low levels of difficulties in transmitting academic information (11.9), with men also being the most unaffected (p = 0.006). More than half of the participants (59.1%) rather see digital and/or virtual education during the pandemic as having adverse effects on the educational system, the most sceptical being teachers of the fifth (p = 0.001) and sixth years (p = 0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic affected the academic staff of the Faculty of Dentistry at “Carol Davila” University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest, Romania, not only at a personal level but also at a professional, pedagogical one, due to the introduction of the online teaching system followed by the hybrid one.

Educators are becoming increasingly aware of the impact of stresses on the students general well-being. The objective of the current study was to examine the prevalence of and risk factors for depressive and anxiety symptoms among first-year and fifth-year medical students. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic has affected students’ mental well-being. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed at the College of Medicine at King Saud University between September 2020 and January 2021. The target population was first-year and fifth-year medical students. Depressive symptoms were screened using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while anxiety symptoms were screened using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment (GAD-7). Students were also directly asked about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental well-being. Outcomes were compared between groups using the chi-squared test and Student’s t test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 182 medical students were included. Depressive symptoms (52.9% versus 35.8%, p = 0.020) and anxiety symptoms (35.6% versus 26.3%, p = 0.176) were higher in the first-year students than in the fifth-year students. Approximately 19.2% of the students were worried about acquiring COVID-19, 49.4% were worried about academic performance, and 30.8% were feeling sad, depressed or anxious during the COVID-19 pandemic. Independent risk factors for depressive symptoms included having concomitant anxiety, being worried about acquiring COVID-19, being worried about academic performance, and feeling sad, depressed or anxious. Independent risk factors for anxiety included having a lower grade point average and having concomitant depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Medical students have an alarmingly high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, which might have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

We propose a route connecting emotional problems and academic performance through executive functioning skills (EFS). Despite the abundance of research on the topic of EFS, there is a significant gap in understanding this route, specifically among a population of undergraduate students. The aim of this study was to examine whether EFS mediated the association between emotional problems and academic performance among undergraduate students. Cross-sectional data (n = 2,531) was used from a survey among Dutch undergraduate students from a large variety of faculties at a university of applied sciences. We assessed emotional problems using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, five EFS (cognitive inhibition, task initiation, sustained attention, planning, time management), and academic performance (study delay; yes/no). Mediation analyses were performed, using the Hayes PROCESS macro, adjusted for gender. We found that cognitive inhibition, task initiation, sustained attention, planning, and time management mediated the association between emotional problems and academic performance. Regarding separate EFS, no large differences were found. The data suggests that improving all EFS in undergraduates experiencing emotional problems could be a fruitful strategy for preventing academic delays. © 2024 The Author(s).

Design: 8 Semi-structured focus groups. Setting: Seven 2- and 4-year Minnesota colleges. Participants: 53 students initially screening positive for FI. Method: The focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis, a systematic approach for identifying and analyzing patterns across qualitative data, was used through four analysis phases to identify themes and categories. Results: We identified five themes within trade-offs: sacrificing food, missing out on relationships, sacrificing academic studies, choosing between basic needs, and maintaining physical and mental well-being. The trade-offs students described were multifaceted, caused notable stress and worry, and presented challenges to students’ well-being. Conclusion: This study provides evidence on the complexities of FI among students and details on what students may be sacrificing as a result of making trade-offs.

Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine if there is a relationship between common mental disorders and emotional fatigue in university students. Method: The approach was quantitative, the design was non-experimental and the type was descriptive correlational cross-sectional. The sample consisted of 215 students who were administered the Self Reporting Questionnaire-SRQ 20 and the Emotional Fatigue Scale, instruments with adequate psychometric properties. Results: The results indicate that common mental disorders were presented with a low intensity and most students had moderate levels of emotional fatigue. Spearman's correlation coefficient rho between both variables was 0.503 and p-value was lower than the significance level (p<0.05). Conclusions: It was concluded that there is a relationship between common mental disorders and emotional fatigue in university students. Therefore, it is recommended that the university implement mental health and education programs on emotional well-being to improve the performance and quality of life of students. © 2023, FACMED - Faculty of Medical and Juridical Sciences.

Academic stress may be the most dominant factor affecting college students' mental well-being. Therefore, improving the monitoring of mental health issues among college students is a vital topic for study. However, identifying the student's stress level is challenging, leading to uncertainty. Hence, this paper suggests Heuristic Fuzzy C-means Clustering Algorithm (HFCA) for analyzing college students' stress levels, psychological well-being and academic performance detection. The data are collected from the Kaggle stress dataset for predicting student mental health. This study investigates the psychological factors affecting students' academic performance using the suggested HFCA. Students' performance may be predicted using the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in this study. This study used fuzzy clustering algorithms to discover the most crucial aspects of student success, such as student involvement and satisfaction. A better understanding of the risk factors for and protective factors against poor mental health can serve as the basis for developing policies and targeted interventions to prevent mental health problems and guarantee that at-risk students can access the help they need. The experimental analysis shows the proposed method HFCA to achieve a high student performance ratio of 96.7%, cognitive development ratio of 97.2%, student engagement ratio of 97.5% and prediction ratio of 95.1% compared to other methods. © 2023 The Author","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The study was designed to investigate the learning burnout of nursing undergraduates in school under the normalization of the COVID-19 epidemic and explore the hypothesized mediation effect of academic self-efficacy in the relationship between anxiety, depression and learning burnout in Chinese nursing undergraduates. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among nursing undergraduates in the school of nursing of a university in Jiangsu Province, China (n = 227). A general information questionnaire, College Students’ Learning Burnout Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9) were administered. Descriptive statistical analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis were performed via SPSS 26.0. Process plug-in (Model 4) was used to test the mediating effect of academic self-efficacy (bootstrap 5000 iterations, α = 0.05). Results: Learning burnout (54.1 ± 0.656) was positively correlated with anxiety (4.6 ± 0.283) and depression (5.3 ± 0.366) (p < 0.01) and was negatively correlated with academic self-efficacy (74.41 ± 0.674) (p < 0.01). Academic self-efficacy plays a mediating role between anxiety and learning burnout (0.395/0.493, 80.12%) and a mediating role between depression and learning burnout (0.332/0.503, 66.00%). Conclusion: Academic self-efficacy has a significant predictive effect on learning burnout. Schools and teachers should strengthen the screening and counselling of students’ psychological problems, detect learning burnout caused by emotional problems in advance and improve students’ initiative and enthusiasm for learning. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Along with all these advantages international students also face many challenges. This study is mainly focused on indicating the potential factors that affect the mental health of students, yet the least studied. It can lead to many problems like difficulty in academics, this can destroy the purpose of going abroad. This review summarizes the most recent information on the variables affecting the mental health of international students with the aim of increasing awareness and encouraging additional study in this understudied field. Methodology: To identify different factors affecting the mental health of students we conducted a systematic review of studies that we took from online search engines like Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct. 10 studies were included that met the inclusion criteria. All the included studies are written in English and published after 2010. Results: Our analysis revealed that new learning techniques, language barriers, currency changes, homesickness, and cultural changes are the potential factors that lead to mental disorders among students studying abroad. All these problems can lead to mental issues like depression, anxiety, stress, fear, social isolation, poor academic performance, and even suicidal ideation. It is important to acknowledge that there may be some limitations associated with research. Findings are associated with reviewed studies that may vary in research approach and sample size.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among Portuguese higher education students during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and investigate DASS-21’s psychometric characteristics and whether it functions effectively during a pandemic. A convenience sampling procedure was used to recruit 1522 participants (75.1% women and 79.2% undergraduate students) for this cross-sectional research. Participants completed an e-survey created using DASS-21. The results revealed a considerable prevalence of symptoms of depression [≥10] (N = 434, 28.5%), anxiety [≥7] (N = 551, 36.2%), and stress [≥11] (N = 544, 35.7%). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed the scale’s three-factor structure, which matched the three DASS-21 subscales. Subsequently, the heterotrait–monotrait (HTMT) correlation ratio evaluated the scale’s discriminant validity, which was relatively good. Cronbach’s alpha measured the internal consistency of the DASS subscales, which was excellent (Cronbach’s α > 0.90). DASS-21 was shown to be a reliable and appropriate measure for assessing students’ mental health. Furthermore, DASS-21 is recommended for use by academics and healthcare professionals in measuring students’ psychological distress. Further validation studies of this scale are needed with larger and more representative samples. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Physical fitness always enables students to perform their various tasks efficiently specifically in academic performance. Student health is a principal factor for the performance of all kinds of activities particularly in academic performance. This study aimed to evaluate physical activity among university students and the factors for being inactive. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was designed and distributed among the students via WhatsApp, Skype and email, however, some responses were collected physically to maintain the quality of data. The questionnaire was categorized into demographic factors, current physical activity status and reasons for physical inactivity. Each section was further divided into questions and total 24 questions were asked from each individual for evaluation of inactiveness. Findings: The finding of this research explored that enormous number of students are doing part time jobs and unable to find enough time for relaxation. The research was limited and evaluated limited factors and explored that 60.6% of students had less time for entertainment and this is only 2 h for this 60.6% of students. Among all factors of physical activity walking was preferable for 48.34% of the students. Students want to participate in healthy activities. Moreover, students are unable to perform physical exercise due to busy schedules of jobs (47.02%), part-time job burden (15.89%), study burden (35.10%) and poor health conditions (1.32%). Originality/value: This study concluded that higher percentage of students have stress of limited resources and under this stress condition they are unable to take a balanced diet which they considered cost-effective. They did not perform maximum in their academic and daily activities and did not participate in sports activities. It was also observed that institutions did not provide a sufficient platform for physical activity for students. The research shows the factors which affect the student’s academic performance as being physically inactive. Evaluation of results explored that numerous students have limited resources during their career development and their attention remain diverted to overcome their limited resources which keep them physically unfit. The findings also explored that physically inactive students have heavy study and job burden which is not overcome and analyzed by their institutions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

Late adolescence is also when elite-striving athletes typically transition from junior-to-senior level programs. In addition, adolescent elite lean sports athletes have an increased risk of suffering from abnormal eating pathology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceived psychosocial needs that young, elite-striving lean sports athletes in sports high schools find essential for their sports careers and transition from junior-to-senior level sports. Eight Swedish elite-striving lean sports athletes (2 men and 6 women; median age 17.0 years, range: 16-18 years) participated in this study and sports represented were athletics (n = 1), gymnastics (n = 3), and wrestling (n = 4). Semi-structured interviews were performed, and data was analyzed by thematic analysis. Results showed integration, both in the present situation and for the future, as an overarching theme perceived as essential for a successful elite sports career over time. Three additional themes were also identified: (a) Psychosocial stress (combined performance demands, diminished social life, sports-related body weight demands, taboo talking about eating disorders, injuries), (b) Protective psychosocial factors (social support and psychological safety, communication and coordination school and sports, self-care/health behaviors), and (c) support needs junior-to-senior transition (career advice and mentorship, individualized support). As a result, elite-striving, lean sports athletes attending sports high schools need additional support to excel in their academic and athletic endeavors. Sports developmental programs continue to provide inadequate support before and during the junior-to-senior level transition. Similarly, despite the continued calls for reducing the stigma of mental health, athletes in sports schools still encounter barriers from coaches and peers, making the subject taboo, particularly surrounding eating pathologies. © 2023 Lundqvist et al.

Our cross-sectional study sought to build upon our previous work and investigate the current dynamic of mental health and potential stressors reported among a sample of university students, as well as potential similarities/differences to previous years. Methods: University students (n = 820 participants who met inclusion criteria; aged 18+) were administered an anonymous survey consisting of questions assessing: (1) demographics, (2) mental health (depression, anxiety, stress), and (3) potential stressors. Results: Our results indicate a significant proportion of students reporting severe and extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress, with a substantial increase in severe and extremely severe levels relative to previous years. Similar to our previous work, academic performance, pressure to succeed and quality of sleep were among the top stressors reported. Significant predictors of mental health included pressure to succeed, self-esteem, body image and relationship with friends and family. Limitations: A key limitation of this study includes its cross-sectional, rather than longitudinal, design. Conclusions: The university student population appears to be experiencing a continued shift towards worse mental health. In addition to the traditional college-related sources of stress, consideration is also necessary of the impact of non-college-specific stressors that could linger beyond the individual's time in college. This approach, along with consideration of the deeper underlying contributors to such stressors, may potentially assist in more appropriately, proactively, and successfully addressing the global mental health pandemic. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

With implications extending towards poorer academic performance and overall student mental health, there is an urgent need to address this growing concern. As such, we conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to summarize data in the literature on the overall prevalence of anxiety among college and university students. Moreover, this umbrella review also considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed potential moderators through distinct subgroup analyses. A systematic search was carried out across various sources, including five databases, five journals, Google Scholar, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, which yielded 25 reviews that met inclusion criteria. Sample sizes ranged from 1,122 to 1,264,132 (Mdn = 22,171) that covered all regions including Africa, Arab States, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East, North America, and South America. Findings from these 25 reviews were subsequently synthesized narratively. The overall prevalence of anxiety among college and university students had a median of 32.00 % and ranged from 7.40 to 55.00%. Subgroup analyses revealed that being female, living in Asia versus Europe, and being an undergraduate were associated with higher levels of anxiety. In addition, an increase in anxiety was observed pertaining to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Hence exposing them to a certain amount of strain may sometimes cause sleep disruptions. The purpose of this study was to determine the sleep quality among Saudi Applied Medical Sciences students and its potential connections with their academic performance and mental health. Methods: This online cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted at Jazan University’s College of Applied Medical Sciences in Saudi Arabia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a known indicator of sleep quality, a validated mental health measure; Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), and Academic Performance Scale (APS) with 89 internal consistencies were included in the questionnaire. The cumulative grade point average (GPA) was also used as a covariate to evaluate students’ academic success. Results: 112 people responded (response rate = 93%), and 105 of them presented comprehensive information about their backgrounds, way of life, academic standing, sleep patterns, and mental health. Participants’ average GPA and APS scores were 4.23 ± 0.52 and 33.16 ± 5.63, respectively. The mean global PSQI score was 6.47 with 2.34 of standard deviation (SD). The majority of individuals (60%) had poor sleep quality particularly due to abnormal sleep latency and lesser sleep duration, as determined by their PSQI score. The prevalence rates for depression, anxiety, and stress were higher; 53%, 54% and 40%, respectively. Both depression and anxiety were substantially correlated with poor sleep quality (p-value = 0.008, p-value = 0.01, respectively). Sleep quality had no significant effect on GPA while global PSQI and depression were significantly negatively correlated with an APS score of participants (p-value = 0.007 and 0.015, respectively). Conclusions: Higher rates of poor sleep quality and psychologically negative emotions were prevalent. Unhealthy sleep patterns were linked to increased levels of anxiety and depression. Self-perceived academic performance was negatively impacted by inadequate sleep and negative emotions, despite the fact that the GPA results were unaffected. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The aim of the study was to verify if and how individual factors (resilience and positivity) and socio-environmental factors (social support and nationality) allow prediction of the level of perceived stress. University students (n = 559) from Poland, Serbia, and Italy were surveyed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the Positivity Scale (PS), and the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL-12). Personal resources—positivity, resilience, and support—were found to be positively interrelated and significantly associated with stress levels. Additionally, gender and nationality differentiated stress levels. A general linear model (GLM) showed that levels of perceived stress are best explained by resilience, positivity, tangible support, and gender. The results obtained can strengthen students’ awareness of personal resources and their protective role in maintaining mental health, as well as contribute to the creation of prevention-oriented educational activities. Nationality was not a significant predictor of the level of perceived stress, which highlights the universality of examined predictors among university students from different countries and suggests that interventions aimed at enhancing these resources could benefit students across different cultural contexts. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Anxiety among high school students can affect school performance, relationships, and family life. Objective: Our aim is to understand the anxiety levels and associated factors among high school students and compare the results of psychological tests measuring anxiety with the cortisol levels obtained from biological sampling. Method: In our longitudinal follow-up study, we involved 125 individuals in May 2019. Validated measurement tools were used during questionnaire data collection, including the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory, Clear Communication Scale, Multiple Social Perceived Support Scale, and related HBSC questions. As objective data, we collected hair samples for cortisol level measurement. Results: At the end of the school year, the anxiety levels measured by psychological tests were significantly higher (p = 0.001) compared to the anxiety levels at the beginning of the next school year. Anxiety levels were higher among girls and were influenced by the type of school and parental expectations. Both state anxiety and trait anxiety showed a strong correlation with psychosomatic symptoms (p < 0.001) and anxiety arising from school expectations (p < 0.05). The changes in cortisol levels did not follow the changes in psychological tests.

The study aims to understand the impact of marriage on student engagement and health, examining how married life, interactions with peers, family, and faculty, and involvement in academic and social activities affect students' well-being. Employing a grounded theory approach, the research analyzes the adjustment to married life among college students and its effects on their academic commitment. The findings reveal that marriage introduces complexities such as increased responsibilities and altered social interactions, which could potentially influence students' mental health and academic performance. These factors are critical for biotechnology firms that are developing health and wellness solutions targeted at the college demographic. The study shows that only a small percentage of undergraduate students are married, indicating unique challenges they face, including balancing academic responsibilities with marital life. The relationship quality among these students emerged as a potential factor influencing their academic success and well-being, an aspect crucial for biotechnology companies focusing on mental health interventions. Data from an online survey at a Midwestern college highlights the correlation between marital status and academic performance, with relationship satisfaction and communication playing a negligible role. These insights are vital for biotechnology firms seeking to develop or tailor mental health and wellness programs for this specific group. Furthermore, the adaptation of married students to college life, their social support systems, and levels of marital satisfaction provide a comprehensive understanding of their unique needs and challenges. This knowledge is instrumental for biotechnology firms in creating targeted health solutions, particularly in mental health and stress management, catering to the well-being of married college students. © 2023, Journal of Commercial Biotechnology.

Procrastination adversely affects mental health, academic performance, and career achievement. Although studies on procrastination intervention methods and effectiveness exist, utility and cost-effectiveness are limited by various factors, including practitioner availability and skills, barriers to participant participation, and the time investment required by participants. Thus, internet-based interventions could increase the availability of evidence-based treatments for adult procrastination. Methods: This study explored the efficacy of an online-based self-help intervention in the context of voluntary procrastination among undergraduate psychology students. The study design is a randomized controlled trial. Participants who self-reported procrastination-related problems and behaviours were included in the trial consisting of two groups; specifically, one group undergoing a self-directed internet-based intervention for coping with procrastination (N=160) and (2) another group with delayed access to the intervention programmes (waitlist control group; N=160). Follow-up assessments were scheduled 6 and 12 weeks after baseline, and the control group received the intervention after 12 weeks. Procrastination, measured by the Irrational Procrastination Scale and the Simple Procrastination Scale, was examined as the primary outcome. Meanwhile, secondary outcomes included susceptibility, stress, depression, anxiety, well-being, self-efficacy, time management strategies, self-control, cognition, and emotion regulation. Other measures comprised acceptability (e.g., intervention satisfaction, potential side effects, and expectations) and learning behaviour analysis to reflect adherence. Discussion: This randomized controlled trial will provide data on the effectiveness of online interventions for adult procrastination. If deemed effective, this low-cost, high-coverage internet-based intervention could aid more people who seek to address their procrastination.

Although the percentage of pediatric IBD patients seems to be increasing, rates are surprisingly heterogeneous among different populations. Although the pathogenesis of IBD is believed to be multifactorial, a genetic predisposition may be especially relevant in pediatric-onset IBD. Phenotypic characteristics can also be significantly different when comparing pediatric and adult-onset IBD. Patients that develop the disease at a younger age usually present with more extensive and more aggressive disease and develop complications faster when compared to those that develop it during adulthood. Children with IBD are found to have frequent mood disorders and have a higher risk of developing socio-economic hardship, failing to meet development milestones. Therefore, IBD management should always involve a multidisciplinary team that is not limited to medical providers. Most institutions do not have an established transition protocol and lack the resources and training for transition care. Although there is no consensus on an optimal timing to transition the patient's care to an adult team, it is usually accepted they should be eligible for adult care when most of the key transition points have been met. Management strategies should be tailored to each patient's developmental level and environment. A successful transition can improve the long-term outcomes such as sustained remission, medication adherence, mental health and social and academic performance, while decreasing healthcare utilization. Every institution that manages pediatric IBD patients should have a well-established transition protocol in order to make sure to maintain continuity of care. © 2022 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

The circadian and stress-realizing systems are interconnected, and the balance of their interaction determines the state of human health. The objective of this study was to investigate the modulating effect of activating the circadian system on heart rate variability in female medical students with high anxiety while performing a cognitive task. After 20 min of adequate stimulation of circadian photoreceptors with a monochromatic blue light, the cognitive task performance resulted in a decrease in sympathetic impact. During the session of monochromatic blue light exposure, a trend of increasing heart rate variability was observed in a state of relative rest (especially in the first 5 min). A comparative analysis of the parameters of the letter cancellation test before and after light exposure revealed a statistically significant increase in the indexes reflecting mental productivity, work accuracy, and concentration of attention. The results suggest an essential physiological role of the human circadian system in modulating the autonomic and psycho-emotional conditions, as well as cognitive functions of individuals with high anxiety. Our findings indicate the possibility of quickly correcting the balance in human systemic regulatory mechanisms using the activation of retinal circadian photoreceptors by blue light. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The impacts in children include poor mental health and reduced educational attainment. Providing universal free school meals is one potential way of addressing these impacts. This paper reports findings on the impact of a universal free school meals pilot in two English secondary schools. We adopted a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental design. The intervention schools were one mainstream school (n = 414) and one school for students with special educational needs (n = 105). Two other schools were used as comparators (n = 619; n = 117). The data collection comprised a cross sectional student survey during the pilot (n = 404); qualitative interviews with students (n = 28), parents (n = 20) and school staff (n = 12); and student observations of lunchtimes (n = 57). Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis, and descriptive analyses and logistic regressions were conducted on the quantitative data. Self-reports of food insecurity were high at both intervention (26.6%) and comparator schools (25.8%). No effects of the intervention were seen in the quantitative findings on either hunger or food insecurity. Qualitative findings indicated that students, families and staff perceived positive impact on a range of outcomes including food insecurity, hunger, school performance, family stress and a reduction in stigma associated with means-tested free school meals. Our research provides promising evidence in support of universal free school meals in secondary schools as a strategy for addressing growing food insecurity. Future research should robustly test the impact of universal free school meals in a larger sample of secondary schools, using before and after measures as well as a comparator group. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Survey data are used for empirical analysis of the five themes: socio-demographic contexts; social activities, stress, and well-being; academic performance; course delivery; and student support services. Transformative learning theory and Quadruple Helix Model are used as a framework to explore the breadth and depth of such five themes. As the descriptive study shows, the majority of UCN students are over 25 years old and study in their first and second year with major challenges such as Internet connectivity, private space, and interruption. Mean values reveal that the remote learning performance is determined by concerns about COVID-19 infection, mental and physical health, isolation and lack of socio-cultural activities, students’ self-preparedness and motivation, and support services. The regression analysis shows that students’ concerns about COVID-19 infection interference with course completion are directly affected by their worries about themselves or someone in their families who could be exposed to COVID-19, their mental health, and blended course delivery. Therefore, students’ remote learning performance and their well-being will be enhanced if we take into consideration improving social distancing, educational technology, and course delivery with community–university culturally responsive collaboration. The research findings and the reviewed literature attest that transformative learning theory fits UCN’s remote learning practices to meet educational goals through the university–community collaboration, which is supported by the Quadruple Helix model. As a result, such remote learning practices engage students, particularly Indigenous students, and the practices will help upgrade universities with similar attributes globally into Mode 3 universities, contributing to community economic development. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Adolescents are especially susceptible to depression due to the great biopsychosocial changes in this stage of life. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors and protective factors associated with adolescent depression that are evidence-based. METHODOLOGY: A bibliographic search was carried out in the WoS, PUBMED, Scopus, and VHL databases. Standardized descriptors used to conduct the search included Adolescent AND protective factors OR risk factors AND depression. 38 articles were selected. RESULTS: 38 factors were identified, classified as risky and protective, and grouped into the following dimensions: A) biological: Gender, age, BMI, health problems; b) psychological: Negative or positive affection, negative thoughts, satisfaction with body image, stress, alexhythemia, quality of life, self-regulation, self-esteem; and c) social, subdivided into three groups: C.1) habits, physical activity, consumption of harmful substances, screen addiction, lifestyle that needs to be improved, sexual activity, community participation, sleep duration, academic performance; c.2) family context: Experiences, parent-child relationship, composition, socioeconomic level, functionality, educational level of parents; and c.3) environmental:: social support, bullying, exposure to violence, belonging to an urban school, negative life events, school involvement, neighborhood with green areas and health literacy. CONCLUSION: Several factors that affect depression in adolescents are reported by the literature. In the biological dimension, they tend to be risk factors, and in the psychological and social dimensions, they may increase risk or be protective. Knowledge of these factors by the nurse is essential to guide interventions. © 2023, Escuela de Psicologia Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

Both of them face academic pressure in their own set of way, students have intense competition in academics whereas teachers are often evaluated based on their student's performance. Other examples creating mental stress are workload, social pressure, lack of support from parents in student's case or higher authorities in teacher's case, mental health stigma. In India people really don't take care of their mental health or visit a psychiatrist due to the fear of people's judgement, hence an application for analyzing mental health is great method to detect mental health issues.

We examined the prevalence of risk and resilience factors among adolescents with LBLD (N = 93), ages 16–18, and the association with reading performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected at the start and end of the first fully remote academic year of COVID-19 (2020–2021). Participants completed standardized word and text reading measures, as well as self-report surveys of executive functions (EF), and socio-emotional skills associated with resilience (grit, growth mindset, self-management, self-efficacy, and social awareness) or risk (anxiety, depression, COVID-19 related PTSD, and perceived COVID-19 impact). Survey data at the start of the school year (Time 1) captured three underlying factors associated with socioemotional risk, socioemotional resilience, and regulation (i.e., EF). Path analyses revealed that students’ Time 2 oral reading scores were significantly and uniquely predicted by socioemotional resilience, even when controlling for word-level reading at Time 1. Socioemotional risk, EF, and perceived COVID-19 impact were not directly related to Time 2 oral reading scores; however, students’ resilience mediated the associations between risk and reading outcomes. These results demonstrate that adolescents’ mental health concerns, self-regulatory ability, and socioemotional resilience were all associated with their experiences of the COVID-19-related stress. However, despite the high-risk context of the pandemic, and socio-emotional challenges faced by students with LBLD, our findings indicate that resilience directly predicts end-of-year reading outcomes and mediates the impact of socioemotional risk on achievement. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This study aimed to identify which factors, existing prior to the pandemic (summer term 2019), might be related to resilience when dealing with academic demands during the pandemic (summer term 2020). A sample of 443 university students took part in a longitudinal survey study at a large university in Germany. Resilience, defined as the level of adaptation to a stressor, was operationalized by modeling latent change scores of emotional exhaustion, depression, and somatization in the face of study stress. Multiple regression analyses were performed to analyze how potential facilitating and hindering factors were related to resilience demonstration while controlling for study stressors (workload, work complexity, and change in time spent studying). Academic self-efficacy was positively related to various forms of resilience demonstration, while competition was negatively related. Performance pressure was negatively related to only one form of resilience demonstration. No evidence was found for social support (from lecturers or fellow students) being positively related to the demonstration of resilience. This study confirms previous findings regarding relevant resilience factors such as self-efficacy. It also reveals unexpected aspects such as social support, and it indicates new constructs in resilience research in a university setting such as competition and performance pressure. Practical implications can be drawn fromthis research to benefit resilience promotion among students in preparation for challenging times. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Depressed elders score higher in neuroticism than nondepressed older individuals. Independently, the presence of neuroticism and the number of stressful life events are each associated with worsening cognitive decline in depressed older adults. Yet little is known about combined effects of changes in neuroticism and changes in stress on cognitive decline among older depressed adults. Design: Longitudinal observational study. Setting: Academic Health Center. Participants: The authors examined 62 participants in the Neurobiology of Late-life depression (NBOLD) study to test the hypothesis that, compared with older depressed subjects who experience improved neuroticism and lower psychosocial stressors over time, those with worsening neuroticism and greater psychosocial stressors will demonstrate more cognitive decline. Measurements: The authors measured neuroticism using the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised at baseline and 1 year. Study psychiatrists measured depression using the Montgomery-Ǻsberg Depression Rating Scale. At annual assessments, subjects reported the number of psychosocial stressors in the prior year and completed a neuropsychological evaluation. Participants completed a detailed neuropsychological battery at baseline and annually over 3 years. The battery included a test of delayed story memory (Logical Memory-2 or LMII). The outcome 3-year change in cognitive scores was regressed against 3-year change scores of neuroticism and number of psychosocial stressors, plus their interaction, while adjusting for sex, age, race, education, baseline cognitive score, and 3-year change in MADRS score as covariates. Results: In multivariable linear regression analysis with the above covariates, the interaction effect of 3-year change in Total Neuroticism score and 3-year change in Total Stressors on change in LMII performance was statistically significant (B = −0.080[95%CL: −0.145 to −0.015], T = −2.48, df = 52, p = 0.017). Further exploration of this finding showed that 1) when total stressors increased by 2 or more over 3 years, LMII change was inversely associated with neuroticism change; and 2) when neuroticism improved less, LMII change score was inversely associated with total stressor change. There were no other significant interactions between stress and neuroticism on cognition. Conclusion: Our findings document the importance of tracking change in neuroticism and monitoring psychosocial stress over the long-term course of treatment in geriatric depression. Both factors exert important combined effects on memory over time. Future studies in larger samples are needed to confirm our results and to extend them to examine both cognitive change and development of dementia. © 2022 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In particular, rates of school-pressure have increased significantly. Despite such increases, little is known about the underlying determinants of increased adolescent stress, making this an emerging public health concern. The educational stressors hypothesis contends that increased rates of stress result from pronounced performance pressures placed on adolescents resulting from educational policy initiatives which emphasizes academic goal attainment. The present study tests this hypothesis using a synthetic control method and panel data techniques to analyse data from the Health Behavior in School-aged children (HBSC) survey, including more than 150,000 adolescents per survey wave in 25 European countries over 16 years, to assess if the Swedish Educational reforms implemented in the 2011–13 period were associated with increased self-reported school-pressure. These reforms implemented increased summative assessments, new grading systems and increased eligibility criteria in accessing further education. Results demonstrate that following the reforms, Swedish adolescents experienced greater levels of school-pressure and led to a greater gender difference in experienced school-pressure where girls were relatively more affected. We conclude that, consistent with the educational stressors hypothesis, the educational reforms have likely contributed to increasing levels of school-pressure for Swedish adolescents. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Since the pandemic situation, students have received more assignments and other tasks due to the shift of classes to an online mode. Students may not realize that they are stressed, but it may be evident from other factors, including sleep deprivation and changes in eating habits. In this context, this paper presents a novel ensemble learning approach that proposes an architecture for stress level classification. It analyzes certain factors such as the sleep hours, productive time periods, screen time, weekly assignments and their submission statuses, and the studying methodology that contribute to stress among the students by collecting a survey from the student community. The survey data are preprocessed to categorize stress levels into three categories: highly stressed, manageable stress, and no stress. For the analysis of the minority class, oversampling methodology is used to remove the imbalance in the dataset, and decision tree, random forest classifier, AdaBoost, gradient boost, and ensemble learning algorithms with various combinations are implemented. To assess the model’s performance, different metrics were used, such as the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results showed that the efficient ensemble learning academic stress classifier gave an accuracy of 93.48% and an F1 score of 93.14%. Fivefold cross-validation was also performed, and an accuracy of 93.45% was achieved. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) value gave an accuracy of 98% for the no-stress category, while providing a 91% true positive rate for manageable and high-stress classes. The proposed ensemble learning with fivefold cross-validation outperformed various state-of-the-art algorithms to predict the stress level accurately. By using these results, students can identify areas for improvement, thereby reducing their stress levels and altering their academic lifestyles, thereby making our stress prediction approach more effective. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Physical activity plays a vital role in the mental well-being of adolescents; however, due to the prevailing educational philosophy prioritizing academic performance, adolescent participation in physical activities has yet to reach its full potential. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effects of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on adolescents’ emotional intelligence, psychosocial stress, and self-rated health status. To achieve this objective, a cluster sampling method was employed to collect data from 600 adolescents in 10 schools across five municipal districts of Changsha, China. A total of 426 valid questionnaires were returned and analyzed. Utilizing AMOS v.23, a structural equation model was constructed to validate the hypotheses. The findings reveal that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity significantly impacts adolescents’ emotional intelligence and self-rated health status. Conversely, it exerts a significant negative influence on their psychosocial stress. Moreover, emotional intelligence and psychosocial stress mediate the relationship between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and self-rated health status. In light of these results, education departments, schools, and families must embrace a paradigm shift in educational philosophies and provide robust support for adolescents to engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activities. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Improving attention levels and learning capacity may assist in ameliorating academic performance. Qigong is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that appears to have positive effects on the management of mental health and may provide tools for coping with stressful situations. This paper explores data obtained while conducting a previous study and includes an excess of data from a total of 44 participants who were previously divided into an experimental Qigong group and a sham Qigong control group. The improvements in specific auditory processing and reaction times may indicate benefits in attention and learning capacity. These improvements were more pronounced in the experimental Qigong group compared to the sham Qigong group. Qigong may be able to assist in improving students’ academic performance and can be easily integrated into physical education classes. It could also assist students to cope with the increased academic pressure resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic context. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

For some individuals, greater online engagement can lead to online dependency, which can be associated with depression. The present study explored the association between problematic use of the internet, social media, and smartphones with depression symptoms among Ugandan medical students. Methods A pilot study was conducted among 269 medical students at a Ugandan public university. Using a survey, data were collected regarding socio-demographic factors, lifestyle, online use behaviors, smartphone addiction, social media addiction, and internet addiction. Hierarchical linear regression models were performed to explore the associations of different forms of online addiction with depression symptom severity. Results The findings indicated that 16.73% of the medical students had moderate to severe depression symptoms. The prevalence of being at risk of (i) smartphone addiction was 45.72%, (ii) social media addiction was 74.34%, and (iii) internet addiction use was 8.55%. Online use behaviors (e.g., average hours spent online, types of social media platforms used, the purpose for internet use) and online-related addictions (to smartphones, social media, and the internet) predicted approximately 8% and 10% of the severity of depression symptoms, respectively. However, over the past two weeks, life stressors had the highest predictability for depression (35.9%). The final model predicted a total of 51.9% variance for depression symptoms. In the final model, romantic relationship problems (β = 2.30, S.E = 0.58; p<0.01) and academic performance problems (β = 1.76, S.E = 0.60; p<0.01) over the past two weeks; and increased internet addiction severity (β = 0.05, S.E = 0.02; p<0.01) was associated with significantly increased depression symptom severity, whereas Twitter use was associated with reduced depression symptom severity (β = 1.88, S.E = 0.57; p<0.05). Conclusion Despite life stressors being the largest predictor of depression symptom score severity, problematic online use also contributed significantly. Therefore, it is recommended that medical students' mental health care services consider digital wellbeing and its relationship with problematic online use as part of a more holistic depression prevention and resilience program.  © 2023 Sserunkuuma et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Gradeless learning has been shown to ease the pressure on students because it encourages a focus on learning rather than performance. Indeed, gradeless learning has been documented to benefit well-being, stress reduction, motivation, and learning approach, but its influence on academic performance requires more investigation. Drawing on a quantitative analysis, we empirically examine the effect of gradeless learning on a broad set of outcomes including well-being and stress, but focus specifically on students’ later academic performance as measured by grades. Our findings reveal that gradeless learning can increase motivation and reduce surface learning but has no significant effect on students’ later academic achievements. The study concludes that gradeless learning can provide a relevant alternative to grades if carefully designed. © 2023 The Author(s).

Adolescents are often expected to balance academic performance with familial obligations and work to support the family financially if they belong to low-socio-economic areas. These pressures can lead to Anxiety, stress, and even depression. Objective The study’s main objective is to assess the association of gender, parenting style, eating habit, and screen timing with the level of Anxiety among school-going adolescents in three peri-urban areas of Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents of age group 10–19 years using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale in two months in, three populated peri-urban areas of Karachi, Pakistan. Collected Data was analyzed by statistical software SPSS version with 80% response rate. Finding In our collected data, 544 students participated; 313 (57%) were female, and 231(42%) were male. Among them 173(33%) participants showed moderate to severe level of anxiety out of which 140(26%) were female and 33(7%) were male. As per our study, strict Parenting style plays a significant role in developing moderate to severe 108(20%) levels of Anxiety, shown among adolescents in the studied population. In addition to this, those who do not take tuition 115 (21%), do not use transport to school 91(16%), spend significant time in games on mobile and computer 101 (18%), and have no involvement in physical activities 172 (31%) show more moderate to severe level anxiety than others factors. A significant multivariate association between level of anxiety with gender, school commute, type of lunch Intake, smoker family member at home, physical activity, video game, tuition and strict parent. Conclusion This study concluded that there are various factors which have great association with anxiety and can affect adolescents’ mental health badly. The factors were parental strictness, video game playing, a sedentary lifestyle, and the smoking habits of family members. Children and adolescents must be evaluated as soon as possible while they are still young to prevent mental health issues.

The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of COVID-19 on the role functioning and perceived stress levels of students suffering from migraine-like headaches. Methods: Two identical cross-sectional surveys were sent to students in Fall 2019 and Spring 2021 at a mid-sized university in the U.S. The students were queried on the headache impact scale (HIT-6) and perceived stress scale (PSS-10). Associations between the migraine-like headaches, severity of the headaches, stress levels, and headache impacts on the individuals’ role functioning were analyzed. Results: The average age of the respondents (n = 721) was 20.81 ± 4.32 years in 2019 and (n = 520) 20.95 ± 3.19 years in 2021. A difference (p = 0.044) was found in the HIT-6 score <49 category. The other categories of the HIT-6 and the PSS-10 were not significant. Conclusions: During COVID-19, more students answered that their migraine-like headaches had lower impacts on their role functioning, thus suggesting that the students were having less severe migraines. A trend was seen for student’s stress levels, indicating a decrease from 2019 to 2021. Furthermore, our results showed that the impact of headaches and stress levels slightly declined throughout the pandemic. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The administration of the school, can use different steps in order to improve performance among pupils by motivating them to achieve their objectives and providing them with the necessary training and direction so that they can pass the entrance test for their further education by being aware of their areas of strength. We have developed a web application as a solution to the aforementioned issue, allowing the administration to gather pupil information and save it in a database for use in tracking attendance, marks, and performance. Next data gathering, the factors that determine the pupil's result are separated and entered into a web application that can forecast whether the pupil will pass the entrance exam. For the purpose of determining if the student is prepared to take their tests with confidence, a quiz that assesses the students' mental health is provided before the inclusion of this prediction. If the management or mentors of the institute determine that a student cannot pass the test or that their mental health requires extra coaching, they can offer them adequate counsel. Our project involves developing an effective web application that uses the random forest machine learning algorithm to examine the mental health of the student. We installed it in our web application since we obtain an accuracy of 94%. This online application will serve as a conduit between high school students and the administration of the school.

However, experiencing the whole year with online learning might be overwhelming and uncomfortable for first-year undergraduate students. Hence, this might lead them to have mental health consequences, such as stress or fatigue, through the past year doing online learning and also might bring impact on their academic performance. Stress and fatigue levels in students may be high since they had to sit and face monitors every time they joined a lecture with an online learning platform yet the level has not been identified yet. They might experience the symptoms most of the time and every day due to the lecture and group discussion for given projects or assignments. This study aims to measure perceived academic stress levels among first-year undergraduate students in online learning during the pandemic outbreak and how they overcome it. An 18-items questionnaire based on Perceived Academic Stress (PAS) is administered to the first-year undergraduate students of a faculty at Universitas Airlangga on a 5-point Likert scale. We tested the level of academic stress from those selected instruments to measure their academic stress over the past year. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. We used Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis method to investigated the difference in PAS scores between male and female students and among study programs in the faculty, respectively. The result of this study shows that data science technology students perceived significantly difference perceived of academic stress level with students from other majors, except electrical engineering. In addition, the result shows no significant difference perceived of academic stress between males and females. Further studies are necessary to conduct how mental health and stress would affect their academic performance, and how to reduce the risk. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Methods: The sample of the study consists of 217 adolescents in the 13–17 age group who are school-going, 102 refugee adolescents, and 115 non-refugee adolescents. The study data was obtained using the Sociodemographic Characteristics Questionnaire developed by the researchers, Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire (OBVQ) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 42 (DASS-42). A structural equation model was used to assess the association between bullying victimization and depressive symptoms, while also considering mediation by stress and anxiety. Results: In this study, 44.1% of refugee adolescents reported experiencing at least one bullying victimization, while this rate was 27.8% in the non-refugee group, and this difference was found statistically significant. The logistic regression analysis revealed that poor school performance was a risk factor for bullying victimization in refugee adolescent. Moreover, the structural equation model analysis revealed that bullying victimization significantly increased the stress level in refugee adolescents, and depressive symptoms were significantly affected by stress and anxiety levels.

This study examines the association between short-video application use (SVU) and psychosocial factors in 1,346 adolescents (Mage = 14.97, 51.8% female). 199 non-users and 1147 users (686 moderate users, 461 addictive users) were identified. Results revealed a high prevalence of addictive SVU in the sample. Addictive users exhibited worse mental health conditions than non-users and moderate users, including higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, social anxiety, attention problems, and lower life satisfaction and sleep quality. Addictive users also faced higher academic stress, poorer academic performance, more bullying victimization, worse parental relationships, more negative parenting styles, and lower parental education levels. Moderate users had different family environments than non-users, but no differences in mental health or school performance. Together, these findings suggest that addictive users experience a more disadvantageous situation across mental health, family, and school conditions, while non-users have advantageous family environments. Moderate SVU may not be associated with negative mental health condition or poor school performance. Moderate and addictive SVU should be considered distinct phenomena. Given the psychiatric symptoms present in addictive users of TikTok and similar apps, targeted interventions and treatments are urgently needed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

An optional online research survey was administered through a mental health and professional skills initiative of the engineering department to undergraduate first-year engineering students. Perceived stress was found to be a significant predictor of GPA. Post-hoc moderation analyses revealed that the relationship between stress and GPA was buffered by resilience (i.e., weaker stress-GPA relationship at higher levels of resilience) and enhanced by student engagement (i.e., stronger stress-GPA relationship at higher levels of engagement).

We investigated the association of depression and anxiety with university students’ academic performance during the COVID-19 lockdown in Bucaramanga, Colombia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey during the lockdown, through the use of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the grade-point average. Results: 1090 females, out of 1957 students, with mean age 22.2 ± 5.3 years, participated in the study. The prevalence of low academic performance was higher in men (4.7% p = 0.014). As for mental health, 2.5% of the students were classified as “definite cases” of anxiety and 8.2% were diagnosed with depression. Women with a low academic performance had a greater percentage of being “definite cases” (3.8%) of anxiety as compared to men (1.1%). Regarding depression, in men, 12.2% of those with low academic performance were “definite cases” (6.9% p < 0.05); in females with low academic performance, 10.1% were “definite cases” of depression, according to the Poisson regression analysis. The probability of low performance was 100% higher for women identified as “doubtful cases” of depression (PR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.10–5.18, p = 0.03). Conclusions: A positive association between the severity of anxiety/depression and lower grades, especially in women, was found. Mental health should be a special concern when considering university students, in order to improve their academic performance. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The current study set out to identify the prevalence of Facebook Addiction among Bangladeshi medical students as well as its influencing factors. This cross-sectional survey was conducted on 720 randomly selected medical students from eight public medical colleges from January to June 2022. Data were obtained using a semi- structured, self-reported questionnaire and analyzed using the SPSS v.23 programs. The Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale BFAS was used to assess Facebook Addiction, while the Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD-7, Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9, Perceived Stress Scale PSS10, Chen Internet Addiction Scale CIAS, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index PSQI was used to assess anxiety, depression, perceived stress, internet addiction, and sleep quality. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the influence of several demographic, psychological, and behavioral characteristics on the likelihood of respondents being addicted to Facebook. Facebook Addiction was observed in 29.4% of medical students. According to data, 63.7% of medical students reported mild to severe anxiety, 29.3% moderate to severe depression, and 84.9% moderate to high perceived stress. Lack of personal income [OR with (95% CI), 1.82 (1.13, 2.96)], poor academic performance [2.46 (1.45, 4.15)], moderate anxiety [2.45 (1.22, 4.92)], moderate perceived stress [5.87 (1.92, 17.95)], and moderately severe depression [2.62 (.97, 7.08)] were all found to play a significant role in the development of Facebook Addiction.

Students increasingly face demands and challenges that require a large amount of physical and psychological resources. These circumstances can make them experience physical and mental fatigue, lower their interest in studying, and even lead them to lose control over their academic performance and health. The objective of this work is to determine the relationship between the practice of physical exercise, eating patterns, and academic stress among university students. A questionnaire was administered to 742 students using non-probabilistic sampling. The mean age was 21.24 (DT = 3.8), and 20.1% were men and 79.4% were women. To identify academic stress, the Stress Manifestation Scale of the Students Stress Inventory (SSI) subscale was used; the Mediterranean Diet Score was applied for eating patterns, and the practice of exercise was measured by weekly hours of exercise. The results show that there is a relationship between academic stress and physical exercise, but not with adherence to the Mediterranean Diet. However, there is a relationship between the consumption of “unhealthy” foods exceeding the recommendations for the Spanish population and academic stress. In short, physical activity and diet are variables that are related to psychological well-being. Therefore, they should constitute the backbone of actions designed by university managers to eliminate or reduce stress suffered by students. Finally, the work demonstrates the need to create new scales that consider not only the foods that help alleviate stress but also their portions. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Ongoing stressors may lead to chronic stress, adversely affecting their physical and mental well-being. Thus, early detection and monitoring of stress among students are crucial. Wearable artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a valuable tool for this purpose. It offers an objective, noninvasive, nonobtrusive, automated approach to continuously monitor biomarkers in real time, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional approaches such as self-reported questionnaires. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the performance of wearable AI in detecting and predicting stress among students. Methods: Search sources in this review included 7 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar). We also checked the reference lists of the included studies and checked studies that cited the included studies. The search was conducted on June 12, 2023. This review included research articles centered on the creation or application of AI algorithms for the detection or prediction of stress among students using data from wearable devices. In total, 2 independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies–Revised tool was adapted and used to examine the risk of bias in the included studies. Evidence synthesis was conducted using narrative and statistical techniques. Results: This review included 5.8% (19/327) of the studies retrieved from the search sources. A meta-analysis of 37 accuracy estimates derived from 32% (6/19) of the studies revealed a pooled mean accuracy of 0.856 (95% CI 0.70-0.93). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the accuracy of wearable AI was moderated by the number of stress classes (P=.02), type of wearable device (P=.049), location of the wearable device (P=.02), data set size (P=.009), and ground truth (P=.001). The average estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score were 0.755 (SD 0.181), 0.744 (SD 0.147), and 0.759 (SD 0.139), respectively. Conclusions: Wearable AI shows promise in detecting student stress but currently has suboptimal performance. The results of the subgroup analyses should be carefully interpreted given that many of these findings may be due to other confounding factors rather than the underlying grouping characteristics. Thus, wearable AI should be used alongside other assessments (eg, clinical questionnaires) until further evidence is available. Future research should explore the ability of wearable AI to differentiate types of stress, distinguish stress from other mental health issues, predict future occurrences of stress, consider factors such as the placement of the wearable device and the methods used to assess the ground truth, and report detailed results to facilitate the conduct of meta-analyses. ©Alaa Abd-alrazaq, Mohannad Alajlani, Reham Ahmad, Rawan AlSaad, Sarah Aziz, Arfan Ahmed, Mohammed Alsahli, Rafat Damseh, Javaid Sheikh.

Impostor feelings are widespread in the post-secondary population and may be disproportionately experienced by groups already marginalised within academia (e.g., women, racialised students). The IP may be associated with significant mental health issues and changes long-term education and career plans; as such, it is imperative that administrators take steps to address impostorism on university and college campuses. The purpose of this review was to summarise factors of the IP from existing research on the experiences and background characteristics of undergraduate, graduate and professional students (i.e., medicine, law). Findings on the subject of IP and gender as well as IP and ethnicity were inconsistent. Most studies found that IP was negatively related to self-esteem and various dimensions of mental health. The relationship of IP to grade point average was inconsistent but several studies showed a negative association between IP and measures of academic performance. These findings suggest there is a critical need to bring awareness to and address experiences of the IP in the academic community; implications for campus mental health professionals are explored. Limitations of existing research are addressed and directions for future research are discussed. Context and implications Rationale for this study To offer a summary of findings related to experiences of the IP among students in higher education. Why the new findings matter IP is negatively associated with multiple mental health concerns, self-esteem, and measures of academic performance; therefore, interventions are needed to better support students in their academic pursuits. Implications for higher education personnel (e.g., professors, administrators) Implications for mental health professionals and students are discussed. Recommendations for intervention include raising awareness and normalising feelings of IP through workshops and orientations, and resource development with a particular focus on practical strategies to support students in coping with feelings of IP. Earlier intervention to manage IP is needed to curb associated mental health issues and deleterious changes to long-term education and career plans. © 2023 The Authors.

This habitual delay can lead to marked deterioration in performance and potentially harmful implications for mental health. To address this widespread phenomenon, our study employs a ""Research through Design""approach to develop an agent system that effectively curbs procrastination, bolsters self-control, lessens psychological stress and facilitates efficient task completion. Understanding procrastination as a multifaceted issue influenced by both individual characteristics and task nature, our research integrates insights from a comprehensive range of psychological studies. Contributors to procrastination tendencies, such as self-control abilities and perceived task difficulty, form the foundation of our ""Hypothesis Proposal.""Guided by these insights, we introduce two distinctive methods - the ""Self-Agent""and the ""Teacher-Agent.""The Self-Agent method, designed specifically for individuals exhibiting lower self-control abilities, seeks to foster a supportive environment for task completion, thereby reducing pressure and promoting self-regulation. Alternatively, the Teacher-Agent is aimed at individuals with higher self-control abilities, leveraging these inherent traits to enhance task performance further. Our research findings, rooted in the ""Research through Design""approach, suggest that the selection between the Self-Agent and Teacher-Agent impacts both task performance and overall impressions of the system. This difference correlates directly with the users' self-control abilities, underlining the importance of personalized, user-centric strategies in managing procrastination. Although our current study primarily focuses on short-term task execution, we acknowledge the vital role of autonomy in longer-term tasks. Thus, following the ""Hypothesis Proposal,""our future research will explore strategies to mitigate the ""perception of task difficulty,""a well-established catalyst for procrastination. We aim to extend our support beyond the confines of next-day task execution. Our study recognizes its limitations, including the relatively small number of users evaluated. This underscores the need for further user testing to validate our findings conclusively. Refining the agent system to accommodate diverse users presents an imminent challenge. This task necessitates a comprehensive design approach, ensuring that the system is inclusive and robust, effectively serving various user needs. By doing so, we aspire to provide a comprehensive solution to the widespread issue of procrastination, enhancing overall productivity and promoting improved mental well-being.  © 2023 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Therefore, early stress detection is crucial for their successful academic performance and mental well-being. The advent of machine learning (ML)-based prediction models can have a crucial impact in predicting stress at its early stages and taking necessary steps for the well-being of individuals. This study aims to develop a reliable machine learning-based prediction model for perceived stress prediction and validate the model using real-world data collected through an online survey among 444 university students from different ethnicity. The machine learning models were built using supervised machine learning algorithms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the chi-squared test were employed as feature reduction techniques. Moreover, Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were employed for hyperparameter optimization (HPO). According to the findings, around 11.26% of individuals were identified with high levels of social stress. In comparison, approximately 24.10% of people were found to be suffering from extremely high psychological stress, which is quite alarming for students' mental health. Furthermore, the prediction results of the ML models demonstrated the most remarkable accuracy (80.5%), precision (1.000), F1 score (0.890), and recall value (0.826). The Multilayer Perceptron model was shown to have the maximum accuracy when combined with PCA as a feature reduction approach and GSCV for HPO. The convenience sampling technique used in this study only considers self-reported data, which may have biased results and lack generalizability.

The implementation of Participatory Action Research (PAR) through the photo-voice method was a way to encourage adults to recognize problematic situations (at personal, family or community levels) that threaten the well-being of adolescents, but that in everyday life may go unnoticed by parents and caregivers. Our study aimed to identify risk factors for mental health in adolescents living in rural communities of Ecuador from the parental perspective through photographs and focus group discussions. The study sought to raise awareness of this issue at the family and community levels. The photo-voice method was conducted with the participation of 29 parents. The photographs and the collaborative construction of meanings allowed parents to have a better understanding about the importance of mental health and its benefit for adolescents. The principal risk factors mentioned by parents were stress, sleep deprivation, tiredness, poverty, difficulties in continuing education and alcohol consumption. In conclusion, we point out the importance of this intervention to explore the knowledge and understanding of the topic by parents as well as to communicate information that demystifies false beliefs around mental health. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Subjects and Methods: From January 9 to 12, 2022, 780 questionnaires, asking about transmission routes and protective measures against COVID-19, were collected from college students who were quarantined in the dormitory of Yan'an University due to the impact of the epidemic. Moreover, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale were used to evaluate college students' stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. Results: (1) The awareness level and knowledge of epidemic prevention and control among college students from different degree courses were equivalent. College students with urban household residency had a higher awareness of epidemic prevention and control than those living in rural areas. (2) Among the 780 college students, 170 (21.79%) felt stressed; 194 (24.87%) were anxious; 150 (19.23%) people showed depression. (3) Correlation analysis found: (1) Family background: Students with urban household residency are more likely to experience depression (r = -0.090, P < 0.05). (2) Learning status: Anxiety and depression are related to academic performance (r = 0.081, 0.121, P < 0.05). (3) Daily schedule: Sleep quality and schedule are associated with stress, anxiety, and depression (r-sleep = 0.196, 0.204, 0.226, P < 0.05; r-rest = 0.491, 0.458, 0.431, P < 0.05). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 epidemic, college students who were isolated in dormitories had different perceptions of the epidemic due to their different family backgrounds. At the same time, psychological problems such as stress, anxiety, and depression in the isolation period were related to family background, study status, and daily work and rest patterns. © 2023 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Dysfunctional attitudes are the root of numerous mental health problems. On the other hand, perceived social support is recognized as one of the most effective solutions in the treatment of stress and its related disorders. The present study aimed to assess the relationship of social support and dysfunctional attitude with perceived academic stress in the students of Ferdows School of Medical Sciences. Materials & Methods: This descriptive-correlational study was conducted on 121 students of Ferdows School of Allied Medicine and Public Health who were selected via stratified sampling method in the academic year 2019-2020. The data collection tools were demographic characteristics form and three standard questionnaires of social support appraisals (SS-A) scale, vaux a, student life stress inventory (SLSI), and dysfunctional attitude scale 26 (DAS-26). Data were analyzed in SPSS software (version 22) using descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine whether sample data is normally distributed, Pearson and Spearman correlation test to check the relationship between variables, and independent t-test and analysis of variance to compare means between two groups. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean scores of academic stress and perceived social support of students were reported as 2.61±0.49 and 2.42±0.47, respectively, which were lower than the average. Moreover, the mean score of dysfunctional attitude (110.24±78.5) was higher than the standard. Pearson's correlation test pointed to a significant relationship between social support and academic stress (r=0.36; P< 0.001), dysfunctional attitude and academic stress (P=0.006; r =-0.24) and dysfunctional attitude and social support (P=0.005; R=-0.25). Conclusion: The results of the present study pointed out that the variables were closely related to each other, highlighting the importance of these issues in student life. In other words, in order to adjust to academic stress, which is the cause of failure and disruption in academic performance, attention should be paid to various factors at the level of the university, society, and most importantly, family where a person is raised. In this regard, culture building is necessary at the university, society, and family level to shape people's attitudes positively and develop creative thinking based on hope and a burning desire for construction. © 2023 Zanjan University of Medical Sciences.

The aim of this research was to assess the impact of character strengths on emotional distress and academic procrastination. Participants were 255 Psychology majors (71.37 % female) with an average age of 21 years. The sampling method was non-probabilistic, and the following instruments were used: Growing Strong Scale (character strengths), Depression and Anxiety Scales, and Procrastination Assessment Scale for Students. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, and binary logistic regression were conducted. The findings indicate statistically significant differences in character strengths and levels of procrastination and emotional distress between genders. The regressions on the predictive capacity of character strengths in relation to emotional distress reveal that caution, gratitude, and love significantly forecast low levels: creativity, perspective, perseverance, gratitude, and humor were found to be significant predictors for anxiety, while curiosity, kindness, social intelligence, gratitude, and humor were reported for depression. However, none of the strengths showed significant predictive ability for stress. Regarding academic procrastination, the findings indicate that leadership and self-regulation are significant factors. Character strengths can, therefore, be considered to function as protective factors against academic procrastination and emotional distress symptoms, highlighting the importance of promoting them in a university setting. © 2023, Publications Service of the University of A Coruna - Elvina Campus.

It can positively or negatively impact their academic performance and well-being. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of perceived stress among nursing and technical health students and analysing the influencing factors. MATÉRIEL ET MÉTHODES: This is a descriptive, analytical, cross-sectional quantitative study, realised on nursing and technical health care students at the Higher Institutes of Nursing Professions and Techniques of Health of Fez and Rabat using a questionnaire containing socio-demographic data and a scale measuring perceived stress PSS10. RESULTS: The study involved 696 students. The results of the study showed that the majority of students have a perceived stress level ranging from medium (74.9%) to high (19.4%). In addition, good and very good mentions characterize the results of the majority. The determinants related to stress identified were: sex, somatic or psychological disease, the consumption of a psychotropic, sleep disorders, a past trauma, the perception of training as (stressful, or/ and motivating), the training load, the difficulties related to the training, the difficulties related to the examinations and the mentions obtained. The results of the study showed that students with higher grades had a higher perceived stress score. CONCLUSION: Our results show that stress levels are higher among the best-performing students. Improving students' mental health and promoting their well-being is a vital necessity. This can be achieved by integrating specific units for stress management and personal development of students into training programs. © 2023 Act Nerv Super Rediviva.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

K-12 teachers (n = 5856) across three states completed an online survey with questions pertaining to teacher’s experiences surrounding COVID during the Fall 2020 school restart. Using OLS regression, we found that teachers who engaged in dual modalities (both online and in-person and online and in the school building on a regular basis) reported greater levels of perceived stress, anxiety and depression, and lower levels of well-being than those who engaged in “single” modalities (online but not in the building and in-person). This study highlights the additional demands and challenges of balancing two modes of instruction during the pandemic and the toll it took on teacher’s mental health and well-being. Impact Statement Teachers commonly report high levels of occupational stress, and the challenges and demands that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic have only increased. Results from this study found that teachers who juggle both in-person and online instruction had significantly higher levels of stress, greater levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, and worse psychological well-being than teachers who taught only in-person or online. Examining factors that contribute to high levels of stress and mental health challenges in teachers is necessary for creating school contexts that foster both teachers’ and students’ health and well-being as well as academic performance. The development of robust support systems designed to reduce teacher stress and workload will be of paramount importance to combat teacher burnout and attrition in the face of continuing and future challenges. © 2024 National Association of School Psychologists.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

Moreover, students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have been adversely affected by COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of online/hybrid learning on the academic performance and mental health of HBCU pharmacy students during COVID-19. Methods: A survey was developed to assess how COVID-19 affected the mental health and academic performance of pharmacy students who attend a HBCU. The survey collected demographic information and student responses using a Likert-type, multiple-choice, and select all that apply questions. Results: Most participants were women, African American, unemployed, and between the ages of 18 to 25. Most students did not experience a confirmed case of COVID-19 while enrolled. The majority of participants self-identified as visual learners, and most students somewhat or strongly agreed that online learning created a feeling of isolation from teachers and classmates. Furthermore, most students somewhat or strongly agreed that online learning during COVID-19 negatively affected their stress levels and mental health. Many students also disagreed that the faculty displayed empathy towards students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Though most students felt isolated and changed their study habits during COVID-19, they were allowed to freely manage their time and did not find it more challenging to learn and retain information. Unfortunately, mental health and stress levels were negatively impacte,d and there was a significant number of students that felt there was a lack of empathy from faculty members. © 2023","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: Participants reported their ACEs, intrinsic motivation, psychological distress, and financial status as first-semester freshmen. Administrative records (i.e., SAT/ACT scores, GPA, courses taken not counted toward degree progress, and graduation) were collected prospectively over 4 years. Structural equation modeling was used to test the research aims. Post-hoc analyses without SAT/ACT scores were conducted. Results: ACEs were associated with academic problems assessed 4 years later, when studied in isolation (β = 0.36, p < .001) but not after adjusting for other risk factors (β = 0.08, p = .278). Psychological distress and SAT/ACT scores during the first semester predicted academic problems 4 years later (β = 0.33 and − 0.38, p < .001). There was an indirect effect of ACEs on academic problems through psychological distress (β = 0.13, p < .001).

Mental health problems can significantly impact a student's academic performance, career, health, and future if they are not identified and managed in time. The poor mental health of young people is a global problem, including in Nepal. However, the scenario of perceived stress among adolescent students residing in academic hostels is not explored in Nepal. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the prevalence of perceived stress with its associated predictors, experienced stressors, and coping mechanisms among adolescent students residing in private hostels in Nepal. Methods. A cross-sectional study design was employed among all adolescent students of grades six to ten who resided in eight school hostels in Nepal. A total of 209 students responded to self-administered validated questionnaires for perceived stress (PSS-10) and coping scales. Results. More than half (51.67%) of the students experienced symptoms of perceived stress. Strict discipline in the hostel (77.03%) and groupism based on religion (5.26%) were the most common and least common stressors experienced, respectively. One-third of the students (n=70, 33.5%) very often felt confident about handling personal problems. The presence of a mischievous element and neglect from friends were significant stressors determined. Seeking social support was the most used coping strategy over externalizing behaviours such as using bad words, yelling, and shouting. Conclusion. The study confirmed the presence of perceived stress among students living in hostels, where hostel residential factors were the predominant predictors. As a minority of the students can properly manage their stress, it is necessary to provide students with the appropriate educational counselling to help them deal with potential obstacles. Additionally, monitoring, increased communication with family and friends, and improving the hostel environment can be important in addressing students' perceived stress. © 2023 Rajeev Shrestha et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Sports medicine physicians should be familiar with common conditions that may affect the well-being of athletes, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD behaviors have the potential to affect a person's ability to concentrate. It is likely that social and cognitive therapies combined with pharmacotherapy will be the most effective way to treat ADHD in athletes. Medications used for ADHD, especially stimulant types, are known to improve alertness, reaction time, anaerobic performance, and endurance, which would potentially improve athletic performance. Furthermore, stimulant medications may enable student athletes with ADHD to focus on academic studies for longer periods of time, beyond usual levels of fatigue, important for those who may be exhausted after practices and games. The purported performance enhancement effects and potential adverse effects of stimulant medications have prompted many sports governing bodies to ban prescription stimulants or establish strict rules for their use. Athletes taking physician-prescribed stimulants to treat ADHD need to provide the appropriate documentation for approval before competition or risk punitive measures. Physicians should strive to provide a high quality of care to athletes with ADHD through early diagnosis, appropriate and careful multidisciplinary treatment, and complete and timely documentation to facilitate continued sports participation. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Throughout childhood, children are exposed to factors that may promote educational attainment and factors that may be associated with a reduced likelihood of being able to complete their education. The purpose of the current study was to investigate which factors, measured from birth up to finishing upper secondary school, were associated with a lower mean grade point average from lower and upper secondary school as well as eligibility to upper secondary school and college/university. Methods This is a longitudinal study on 1723 children born in 1995/1996 who have been followed until they were 20 years old. Information with respect to maternal sociodemographics, maternal stress factors during pregnancy and childhood, birth characteristics of the child, child behavior at 3 and 12 years of age, and mean grade point average from lower and upper secondary school, including eligibility to upper secondary school and college/university was collected. Results Children exhibiting high problems scores on the child behavior checklist at 12 years of age and children or having other living arrangements (e.g. foster parents or institutional care) were less likely to fulfill the requirements for upper secondary school (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.17-0.71 and OR = 0.33 95% CI = 0.17-0.65, respectively). The likelihood of fulfilling the requirements to college/university was lower if the child had divorced parents at three years of age (OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.16-0.58) and exhibited externalizing problems at 12 years of age (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.24-0.86) and if the mother had experienced high level of stress at (OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.14-0.77). Conclusion Identifying mothers with high level of stressors as well as children with externalizing behaviour problems to provide guidance and support is very important as these two factors appear to be associated with future study performance in both lower and upper secondary school.

One of the most common mental health concerns for student-athletes is feeling overwhelmed or anxious. Early recognition of these symptoms can help student-athletes find early intervention. Objective: To elucidate specific attributes associated with an increased likelihood of anxiety symptoms and treatment avoidance to help athletic trainers and other practitioners better identify and assist high-risk individuals. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Colleges and universities in the United States. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 51 882 varsity athletes who completed the National College Health Assessment between 2011 and 2019. Main Outcome Measure(s): Survey responses (self-report) to questions related to anxiety symptoms and disorders crosssectioned into 9 predictors: year in school, gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, international student status, school type, received information on stress reduction or depression or anxiety, anxiety about impeding academic performance, and history of mental health treatment in the last year. Results: More than three-fourths (82.9%, n = 43 016) of student-athletes reported feeling overwhelmed because of all that they had to do in their daily activities, whereas only half (47.5%, n = 24 645) of student-athletes described overwhelming anxiety as a symptom. Gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, school type, and previous mental health treatment had large effects on these 2 symptoms. However, of the studentathletes who reported overwhelming anxiety as a symptom, only one-fourth (22.9%, n = 5649) indicated they received a diagnosis of anxiety with or without treatment. Conclusions: Factors such as the year in school and availability of mental health information appeared to have little effect on the experience of anxiety-related symptoms and the propensity to seek treatment. However, other factors, including gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, school type, and previous mental health treatment, did have important effects. Our study provides additional evidence that the stresses placed on collegiate student-athletes frequently led to feelings of being overwhelmed and, eventually, anxiety disorder diagnoses. However, most student-athletes experiencing anxiety-related symptoms still did not seek a diagnosis with or without treatment. © 2023 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

The aim of this paper is to examine how the time spent in front of the screen at school influence the developing of computer addiction in primary schoolchildren. The development of Internet addiction has negative educational (deterioration of academic performance), medical (reduced mental health, decreased general stress-resistance, risk of depression), and social consequences (reduced quality and quantity of social contacts). The respondents were 120 parents and 120 secondary school students of one of the schools in Moscow. The participants were asked to answer 9 multiple-choice questions. To assess the level of Internet addiction of schoolchildren, the Internet Addiction Test created by K. Young and modified by V.A. Loskutova (Burova) was used. As a result, 69% of the parents surveyed noted that their children spend more than four hours a day on online learning. Proposed approach consists of two stages, which are a gradual reduction of the time children spend on the Internet and the replacement of problematic behavior with other alternatives. The research results provide the knowledge to prevent cyber addiction in schoolchildren and the incentive for further research. © 2023 The Author(s).

Given the importance of this developmental period, exploring how family socioeconomic indicators linked to the digital divide and health inequities affect parent proxy- and self-seeking is critical to further understanding variability in health information seeking and associated outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to explore parental health-related technology use (HTU), the process by which parents engage in support, advice, and information-seeking behavior related to their (self-seeking) and their children's (proxy seeking) health across a range of hardware devices (eg, tablet, wearable, smartphone, laptop, and desktop computer) and sources (eg, search engines, mobile applications, social media, and other digital media). Methods: A cross-sectional study including 313 parents and guardians of children ages 3 to 8 years recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) was conducted. Parents were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire on a broad range of parenting and parent-related constructs, including sociodemographic information, technology device ownership, and engagement in and use, features, and perceptions of HTU. Descriptive and bivariate analyses (chi-square tests) were performed to identify patterns and investigate associations between family socioeconomic indicators and parent HTU. Results: The overwhelming majority (301/313, 96%) of parents of young children reported engaging in HTU, of which 99% (300/301) reported using search engines (eg, Google), followed by social media (62%, 188/301), other forms of digital media (eg, podcasts; 145/301, 48%), and mobile applications (114/301, 38%). Parents who engaged in HTU reported seeking information about their child's behavior and discipline practices (260/313, 83%), mental or physical health (181/313, 58%), and academic performance (142/313, 45%). Additionally, nearly half (134/313, 43%) of parents reported searching for advice on managing their stress. Among parents who reported using each source, an overwhelming majority (280/300, 93%) indicated that search engines were a helpful online source for proxy- and self-seeking, followed by social media (89%, 167/188), other digital media (120/145, 83%), and mobile apps (87/114, 76%). Among parents who reported using any technology source, approximately one-fifth reported that technology sources were most comfortable (61/311, 20%), most understanding (69/311, 22%), and most influential toward behavior change (73/312, 23%) compared to traditional sources of health information-seeking, including mental health professionals, other health care professionals, school professionals, community leaders, friends, and family members. Indicators of family socioeconomic status were differentially associated with frequency and perceptions of and search content associated with parent HTU across technology sources. Conclusions: The findings of this study underscore critical considerations in the design and dissemination of digital resources, programs, and interventions targeting parent and child health, especially for families in traditionally underserved communities. © Madison P McCall, Megan T Hineline, Margaret T Anton, April Highlander, Deborah J Jones.

Differences between males and females were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test, and Pearson Chi-Square or Fisher exact tests as appropriate, highlighting significant differences between genders regarding the occurrence of anxiety, panic, irritation and annoyance related to work activities. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the perception of work-related anxiety/panic, showing a direct association with the difficulty in work performance and the work-related stress during the pandemic period, whereas, an indirect association was found with job satisfaction and the feeling of being appreciated by colleagues. Occupational stress can increase the risk of developing physical and mental conditions, also affecting work performance and absenteeism. It is therefore fundamental to plan targeted interventions, implement policies and specific actions, in order to avoid and reduce any differences related to gender.

This pilot research study examined the feasibility and perceptions of implementing a success coach-led physical activity (PA) program for freshmen on academic probation in a physiology-related program. Freshman on academic probation [grade point average (GPA) <2.0] worked with a success coach on academic success strategies and PA. Freshmen completed validated surveys (Academic Self-Efficacy, Self-Efficacy of Regulated Learning, Institutional Integration Scale) before and after intervention and semistructured interviews after intervention. Retention rate was determined at longitudinal follow-up in Fall 2022. Six freshmen participated. Average GPA did not improve between Fall 2021 (1.561 ± 0.285) and Spring 2022 (1.606 ± 0.832) (P ¼ 0.89). All felt that the program improved their study skills, but fewer (40%) felt that their grades improved. Most had positive perceptions of the PA program, including self-reported improvements in health/fitness (60%), mood/mental well-being (100%), and stress management (80%). Although most improved attention when studying (80%), this did not translate to improved academic performance (40%). For the Institutional Integration Scales, only the scale for “Faculty Concern for Student Development and Teaching” improved by the end of the semester (pre: 37 ± 7.6, post: 19 ± 3.4, P < 0.001). Retention rate of participants (83%) was higher than the university's overall retention rate for students on academic probation (37%). By fostering social integration, improving mood and mental well-being, and increasing university retention rates this pilot project confirmed the feasibility of using upperclassmen as success coaches for a physical activity intervention for academic probation freshmen.

It is linked to poor academic performance and increased college dropout intentions, as well as several mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Guided web-based interventions can help reduce procrastination. However, guidance by professional clinicians draws upon valuable and limited societal resources, and a more efficient, scalable form of guidance is needed. Guidance by trained clinical psychology students has not yet been examined. Objective: The aim of this open trial is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a web-based procrastination intervention for college students under the guidance of student digital coaches (e-coaches). Methods: We developed a single-arm trial of a guided web-based intervention targeting procrastination for the Dutch student population. Guidance is delivered by trained clinical psychology students asynchronously in the form of textual feedback on intervention progress, with the aim of supporting and motivating the participant. Participants are recruited at 7 Dutch universities. Primary outcomes are intervention satisfaction, usability, and adherence, which are assessed by the Client Satisfaction Scale (CSQ-8), System Usability Scale (SUS-10), and number of completed modules, respectively. The primary outcomes will be examined by calculating descriptive statistics. Secondary outcomes are e-coach satisfaction and changes to procrastination, depression, stress, and quality of life from pre- to posttest and follow-up. Results: The project was funded in 2019, and recruitment began in January 2021. As of May 2023, a total of 985 participants were enrolled, of which 372 had completed the posttest and 192 had completed the follow-up. The expected date of analysis and publication of the results is 2024. Conclusions: The results are expected to contribute to the body of literature regarding eHealth in 3 ways. First, we will examine whether students who procrastinate adhere to and are satisfied with an eHealth intervention targeting this problem. Second, we will explore whether an intervention targeting procrastination can also decrease depression and stress. Lastly, we will investigate whether trained psychology students can effectively guide their peers in web-based interventions. Given the shortage of licensed psychologists, exploring alternative sources of guidance is much needed in order to provide students with the mental health support they need. © 2023 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

To date, there has been little research to understand the factors that influence student mental health within this population. Literature on engineering student mental health supports the idea that engineering students experience high levels of mental health distress, which often stems from stressors such as academic workload, maintaining a strong grade point average (GPA), and pressure from parents and/or professors. Of particular concern, distressed engineering students are less likely to seek professional help when compared to students in other majors. As a result, a comprehensive study was conducted on engineering mental health help-seeking behavior. Through secondary analysis of the data from that study, this work aims to identify common perceived stressors that may contribute to mental health distress, as well as perceived coping strategies that may be used instead of seeking professional mental health help. A diverse group of 33 engineering undergraduate students were a part of the comprehensive study on engineering mental health help-seeking behavior. For this study, qualitative data was analyzed to address two specific research questions: 1) What are the main sources of stress that engineers have experienced in their engineering training? and 2) What coping strategies have students developed as an alternative to seeking professional help? Several common perceived stressors were identified including an unsupportive and challenging engineering training environment, challenges in time management, and academic performance expectations. Perceived coping strategies identified include relationships with family, friends, and classmates and health and wellness activities such as exercise, mindfulness, and maintaining spiritual health. The results of this work will be helpful in recognizing ways to improve engineering education and increase student support. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Study participants were all medical students at King Saud University of Medical Sciences in the first and second years (648 students), and the study was conducted from December 2021 to January 2022. We administered the survey on paper as well as online. We used three types of questionnaires in this study. The first was a self-administered questionnaire, the second was a validated Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for finding sleeping problems, and the third was a validated DASS 10 for determining Depression, Anxiety, and Stress. A total of 361 pre-clinical medical students consisted of 146 (40.4%) males and 215 (59.5%) females. The majority of the students, 246 (68.1%), were in their second year. Furthermore, in the current study, students who had poor academic performance (15.8%), satisfactory academic performance (21.3%), or good academic performance (30.7%) had significant sleeping problems found (χ2 = 19.4; p = 0.001), among them poor academic performance students 21.6%, satisfactory academic performance students (29.3%), and good academic performance students (29.3%) had moderate to severe levelled sleeping problems. Similarly, poor, satisfactory, and good academic performers experienced the highest levels of anxiety (poor = 21.5%; satisfactory = 22.1%; and good = 22.8%); stress (poor = 22.4%; satisfactory = 25.2%; and good = 22.4%); and depression (poor = 40.5%; satisfactory = 40.5%; and good = 11.9%). The majority of students (64.8%) reported that during the pandemic crisis their anxiety levels were high. Additionally, students reported significantly high sleeping issues (χ2 = 10.6; p = 0.001) and also serious psychological issues (Anxiety = 34.9 (0.000); Stress = 32.5 (0.000); and Depression = 5.42 (0.01)). There was a high prevalence of sleep issues, anxiety, stress, and depression among the pre-clinical medical students, with significantly higher sleeping disorders, anxiety, stress, and depression levels among those medical students who struggle with their academic performances, poor lifestyle factor, and poor Social and COVID management. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Thus, the current study aims to assess sleep quality among students and the association of each component of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) with academic performance, mental, and general health. Methods: One hundred and forty-three students participated in the study and filled up demographic forms, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS 21). Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the correlation between PSQI, academic performance, and health among the participants. Logistic analysis was used to determine the significance of association between PSQI and factors like academic performance and health. Results: Analysis of data shows 51.74% participants experienced bad quality sleep. Poor sleep quality was a significant predictor of depression (36.3%), anxiety (19.6%) and stress (29.9%), positive health (21.8%) and negative health (42.6%). Sleep latency as an individual component has a significant negative impact on academic performance. ‘Subjective sleep quality’ and ‘daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness’ had a significant impact on both physical and mental health. Logistic regression analysis of the association between scores on academic performance, mental health, and sleep quality demonstrated significant correlations between quality of sleep and mental health scores (odds ratio = 1.05:1.03–1.06, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Sleep is an important determinant of academic performance, and health of the students. The findings of the study will aid to develop intervention strategies that address the overall health issues of students. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Returning to Chinese institutions, international students in China experienced mental health issues (anxiety and stress). These overseas students’ psychological issues are obstacles to their academic performance in China. Students’ fear restructured their ability to think critically and execute effectively. Consequently, the framework of this study is intended to emphasize the beneficial effects of offline activities, physical activity, and classroom activities on reducing anxiety among international students in China. Methods: This study is predicated on survey data acquired using a five-point Likert scale. 317 responses were received from overseas students enrolled in Hainan universities. Results: The findings show that offline, physical, and classroom activities substantially impact the anxiety reduction of overseas students in China. The study’s contribution to the literature is a fresh concept that previous research has not addressed. In addition, this research has significant theoretical and practical consequences for both knowledge and findings. Conclusion: The study has given a paradigm for relieving anxiety among overseas students in China by addressing a research gap.

Study design and methods: University teachers and academic advisers show an increased susceptibility to occupational risk factors related to their voice and an increased prevalence of developing a voice disorder in the course of their employment. An experimental, prospective, longitudinal study was conducted to examine whether voice training (1) improves physiological vocal function, vocal performance, vocal self-concept, and mental health of university teachers and academic advisers; (2) reduces unfavorable influencing factors at the university workplace; and (3) fewer voice problems are reported from the perspective of university teachers and academic advisers. Results: This study showed that voice training has positive influences on the voice (function and quality), voice self-concept, and well-being of university staff. Conclusions: Workplace prevention programs can help to reduce the high prevalence of voice disorders among university teachers and advisers and counteract the risk factors. They should therefore be firmly integrated into continuing education/university health management and everyday life to cope with certain work-related vocal stresses and to maintain psychological and vocal well-being throughout the university career.

Methods: We conducted a quantitative cross-sectional online survey study using SurveyMonkey. During the 2019–2020 academic year, 383 ODC students across six levels of education were invited to participate in the survey. Descriptive statistics were applied to the students’ demographic profiles, and other characteristics of the participants’ data were analyzed. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated for internal consistency. A univariate analysis was carried out to identify the differences between genders and between the Bachelor of Dental Surgery levels in relation to the questionnaire themes. A Pearson’s correlation test evaluated the association between students’ perception of risks due to the pandemic and the other relevant themes. Results: A 50.9% response rate revealed that five of the themes showed internal reliability ranging from excellent to acceptable, namely: performance of exercise, effect of the pandemic on their families, use of a facemask, college’s online services, and students’ mental health (0.51, 0.59, 0.70, 0.78, and 0.90, respectively). More than half of the participants felt encouraged to engage in self-directed learning using online resources. They felt some level of nervousness, worry, anxiety, or tension as well as stress during the pandemic. Statistical differences between levels of education were noted in the ODC’s-online teaching services (p < 0.001) and students’ mental health (p = 0.03). There was no difference between female and male students. The ODC’s online services theme positively related to the students’ mental health theme (r = 0.22, p < 0.001). Conclusions: ODC students experienced some mental health issues during the pandemic, including anxiety, stress, and sleeping issues. However, the majority of them were healthy. Most students were satisfied with the online teaching provided by ODC. It was also evident that faculty were always connected with the students. A positive relationship was noted between the management of online lectures and students’ mental health. © 2022, Oman Medical Specialty Board.

The Ministry of Education and Higher Education decided in 2019 to further intensify and upscale implementation of school-based psychosocial support. This study is a contextualization and validation of the Student Learning in Emergencies Checklist for use in Lebanon. A 27-item questionnaire was proposed and tested to explore categories for measuring the effect of psychosocial support on academic functioning and academic performance and build evidence for program design. Promotors for school functioning were also explored. The participants (N = 1048) were divided between Lebanese students (N = 573) and non-Lebanese students (N = 520) with a mean age of 11.77 and gender balance. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the combined proposed categories explained 33.7% of the variance of school functioning as opposed to other factors. The new categories for safety and support at school and safety and support at home were found to predict academic functioning alone. Lebanese students reported significantly reduced scores in safety and support at school compared to non-Lebanese students. The need for psychosocial and educational support increased significantly with age, and males reported lower scores than females.

This study aimed to investigate the mental health and academic performance of medical postgraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 20 to April 20, 2022 at the Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: general information, mental health and academic performance. Mental health outcomes were assessed according to the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale (PHQ-9). Results: A total of 153 valid questionnaires were obtained. Of the medical postgraduates in this study, (1) 41.8% had no anxiety symptoms. In addition, 51.0% had mild anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. None of the participants had a severe anxiety or depression disorder; (2) Females experienced significantly more symptoms in mental health measure scores than the males (P < 0.01); (3) 78.4% believed that the COVID-19 pandemic had varying degrees of impact on their academics. Doctoral postgraduates showed greater academic stress, and they were more worried about not meeting graduation standards than the master's postgraduates (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the surgical postgraduates and internal postgraduates in either mental health or academic performance. Conclusions: Our study found that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a mild impact on the mental health and academic performance of medical postgraduates in China. Females experienced significantly more symptoms on mental health measure scores than the males. Doctoral postgraduates showed greater academic stress than the master's postgraduates. There is uncertainty regarding how long this COVID-19 situation will persist and increasing recognition that there may be periods of recurrence in the future. We need more active curricular innovation and transformation to maintain and improve medical postgraduates' mental health and academic performance.

Academic performance in medical students can be influenced by several factors, including those related to mental health and family relationships. Objective. To examine the factors affecting academic performance in medical students, specifically considering potential diagnoses of depression. Method. A survey was conducted among 747 fourth-year medical students. The survey included questions on sociodemographic variables, mental health, and well-being. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) was utilized, encompassing sections on depression, anxiety, panic, eating habits, alcohol consumption, and the Stress Perception Scale. Academic performance was assessed based on students' Grade Point Average (GPA). Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and a linear regression model were employed for data analysis. Results. The study revealed several variables significantly associated with GPA. Age (r = -.388), financial situation (r =.241), relationships with cohabitants (r =.165), and relationships with peers (r =.217) were found to have a correlation with academic performance. Additionally, repeating a course was found to be significantly associated with a person's GPA (r =.518) even after controlling for depression. Discussion and conclusion. The findings indicate that robust mental health, a favorable financial situation, and positive interpersonal relationships are crucial for achieving optimal academic performance in medical students.

Anxiety sensitivity of students seems to affect burnout levels, while emotional intelligence enables emotion management under stressful conditions. The objective of this study is to analyze the roles of anxiety sensitivity and emotional intelligence in academic burnout. (2) Methods: In this quantitative cross-sectional study conducted in Spain, the sample comprised 1287 high school students aged 14 to 18 who filled out the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, the Spanish version adapted for high school students of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, and Brief Emotional Intelligence Inventory. (3) Results: Anxiety sensitivity was significantly higher in cynicism and emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, the mediation analysis showed that high anxiety sensitivity directly affected student exhaustion, cynicism, and efficacy levels. These effects were mediated mainly through stress management but also through the effect of stress management on mood, both emotional intelligence factors. (4) Conclusions: The academic changes that occur during high school hinder engagement and performance. Promoting the development of emotional skills would enable young people to manage their emotions when they become overwhelming and diminish their lack of interest and exhaustion in the classroom. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, sedentary behavior has been reported with ever-increasing demand for competition without clear understanding of the relationship between PA and mental health and academic performance. Therefore, this study observed the changes in the amount PA in 6 grade levels in relation to mental health and academic performance. This study analyzed the amount of moderate and vigorous PA, sedentary time, mental health, and academic performance in male adolescents of 6 middle to high school grade levels by sedentary group (SG: 2 or less min/wk) and physical activity group (PG: 3 or more min/wk) groups depending on the days of weekly PA. The most weekly moderate and vigorous PA duration significant reduced by 29.4% (*P <0.01) and -43.8% (* P <0.01) for H2 in comparison to M1 in SG. The greatest increase in sitting duration 744.95±470.27 min/wk (*P <0.01) was shown by SG. Significant increase in loneliness degree was shown throughout the grade levels of M3 to H3 (2.41±1.08 to 2.50±1.06, * P <0.01) in SG. Degree of stress also significantly increased from M3 to H3 (2.69±0.98, * P <0.01 to 2.90±0.96, * P <0.01) in SG. Finally, perceived academic performance by the days of PA did not show clear difference between SG and PG. In conclusion, regularly performed PA male adolescents showed greater duration of moderate and vigorous PA without negatively influencing mental health and academic performance.

The associated benefits are the major driving forces behind the popularity of social media. Advancements in the technology field, increased affordability, and more technical awareness have lately increased its usage in societies around the world. Currently, more than half of the total world population uses some form of social media. Social interaction is one of the inherited needs of humans. Social media provides easy, cost-effective, and fast outreach to people at far distances. In contrast to traditional methods of communicating and interacting, people can easily reach out to even strangers and with less hesitation on social media. All of these benefits were great enough for social media to expand, but the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic has turned out to be a blessing for social media to expand even faster. The restrictions placed on people during COVID-19 created an almost virtual world. All types of work, schools, and offices had to move online, and much of it was possible. Social media turned out to be a great resource for people to stay connected. Mental health issues increased during COVID-19, but social media was able to aid some relief in that situation. Excess use of social media is being termed an addiction. Comparing the overuse of social media with the psychiatric-based definition, social media can be considered a behavioral addiction. For any behavior, there must be some theoretical reasons that should explain the behavior. The literature review found several theories applicable in explaining social media usage. Attachment, motivation, and learning theories are found to be the most suitable for explaining the increasing rate of social media. Social media does offer multiple benefits, but its uses are also associated with negative health and social and physical outcomes. Depression, anxiety, stress, physical inactivity, sleep problems, poor academic performance, interpersonal issues, and low self-esteem are commonly found in associated people. Children are very vulnerable to social media addiction, and its inappropriate use and a lack of proper understanding among older adults bring a higher risk of scams and phishing. The virtual atmosphere created during the pandemic has some potential to lead to epigenetic effects on babies who were conceived during that phase. In a nutshell, social media has advantages, but its disadvantages are not ignorable. Public health interventions are needed to address the negative effects of social media. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

These skills are relevant for: learn-ing, professional performance, mental health, and well-being. The objective is to analyze the psychometric properties of the Social and emotional Competencies Questionnaire SEC-Q in Chilean university students. Method: The sample included 699 university students, 493 women and 206 men. The internal structure was analyzed through cross validation, an exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity were determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the subscales of the SEC-Q with the Scale of Perceived Self-Efficacy Specific to Academic Situations, Life Satisfaction and Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: adequate psychometric properties in the questionnaire, observing the four components proposed by the structure of the original instrument-self-awareness, self-man-agement, social awareness and decision-making. These competencies showed, as expected, a positive relationship with self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and an inverse relationship with stress. Also, social awareness presented differences according to gender, being higher in women than in men.

This study examines mental health among U.S college students during the subsequent 2020–2021 academic year by surveying students at the end of the fall 2020 and the spring 2021 semesters. Our data provide cross-sectional snapshots and longitudinal changes. Both surveys included the PSS, GAD-7, PHQ-8, questions about students’ academic experiences and sense of belonging in online, in-person, and hybrid classes, and additional questions regarding behaviors, living circumstances, and demographics. The spring 2021 study included a larger, stratified sample of eight demographic groups, and we added scales to examine relationships between mental health and students’ perceptions of their universities’ COVID-19 policies. Our results show higher-than-normal frequencies of mental health struggles throughout the 2020–2021 academic year, and these were substantially higher for female college students, but by spring 2021, the levels did not vary substantially by race/ethnicity, living circumstances, vaccination status, or perceptions of university COVID-19 policies. Mental health struggles inversely correlated with scales of academic and non-academic experiences, but the struggles positively correlated with time on social media. In both semesters, students reported more positive experiences with in-person classes, though all class types were rated higher in the spring semester, indicating improvements in college students’ course experiences as the pandemic continued. Furthermore, our longitudinal data indicate the persistence of mental health struggles across semesters. Overall, these studies show factors that contributed to mental health challenges among college students as the pandemic continued.

Design: a systematic literature review was conducted accord-ing to the PRISMA 2020 Guidelines. The literature search was conducted on 4 different databases: MedLine, Embase, Psy-cINFO, and L.OVE Platform. Quantitative observational studies published until 10.01.2022 were included. Studies conducted during the first pandemic wave, i.e., during the 2019-2020 school year and/or during the mandatory lockdown or confinement period, were excluded. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with validated scales. Study selection, data ex-traction, and quality assessment were carried out independently by two authors. Setting and participants: children, adolescents, and young people attending all levels of education (including universities) and, for reasons related to COVID-19, having a suspension of “in presence” school or attending classes remotely. Main outcome measures: a. outcomes directly related to mental health: suicides, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for psychiatric problems; anxiety and depression, emotional difficulties, feelings of loneliness and isolation; b. well-being outcomes: sleep quality, perceived well-being (by child/adolescent/youth or referred by parents); c. health-related behaviours: tobacco smoking, alcohol, drug use. Outcomes related to school/academic performance, phys-ical health, and those related to parents were not considered. Results: after having removed duplicate articles, 2,830 re-cords were retrieved with the bibliographic search. Twelve studies (2 uncontrolled before-after studies and 10 cross sectional surveys) were included, involving a total of 27,787 participants. Three studies involved university students, 2 involved high school students, and the remaining involved a mixed population of students attending primary and middle schools. The studies were conducted between September 2020 and April 2021. The methodological quality was rated as high in five studies and intermedi-ate in the remaining studies. Due to the high heterogeneity of out-come measures and statistical analyses performed among the included studies, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis of the results of the considered publications. Nevertheless, the present review showed a clear signal of increase in mental health problems in relation to school closure or virtual instruction. In par-ticular, results suggest evidence of association between school closure and risk of suicidal attempts or thoughts, mental health symptoms such as anxiety, depression, emotional disorders, psychological stress. Sleeping problems, drug and alcohol addiction were poorly studied. Conclusions: despite the limitations of the included studies and possible residual confounding and contamination due to re-strictive measures and social isolation implemented during the pandemic, the available evidence confirms the negative impact on students’ mental health associated with school closures and distance learning. Given the availability of vaccination also for young children, a long period of school closure should be avoided also in the case of the emergence of new pandemic waves. © 2022, Inferenze Scarl.

METHODS: To scientifically support the system of assisting students with enhanced mental abilities in the face of risk factors within the educational environment, a one-stage study was conducted at a multidisciplinary lyceum for gifted adolescents. The study focused on identifying risk factors associated with the organization and intensity of the educational process and daily routine of students in grades 9–11. To further support the use of biofeedback in the school medical system, students were taught the diaphragmatic breathing technique. The effectiveness of this technique was evaluated through a comparative analysis of the functional state of the central nervous-and cardiovascular systems, as well as the psycho-emotional status of students before and after two weeks of functional biofeedback training. RESULTS: We found that students were at risk for health problems due to poorly organized educational activities, high intensity of studies and neglect of health-promoting habits such as adequate sleep and walking. However, it has also been found that academic demands can enhance mental performance, albeit at the cost of increased stress on the body's regulatory systems. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a support system for students that addresses these concerns. One promising intervention is diaphragmatic breathing training, which has been shown to reduce anxiety and improve mental performance and adaptability in students. CONCLUSION: Our findings have enabled the scientific substantiation and development of a comprehensive system to support students with enhanced abilities throughout their educational path. This system involves assessment of the psychophysiological state of students, identifying those at risk and those in good health, and organizing a range of corrective, health-promoting, and health-protecting measures. These measures are designed to enhance compensatory capabilities and psychophysiological reserves, as well as to strengthen students' health during the learning process. © Eco-Vector, 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

It has been found that social resources such as social identity, dual identity and social support help buffer negative mental health outcomes. Notably, social status has been found to weaken the connection between stress and depressive symptoms. Based on these findings, the present study investigates how social resources (i.e., social identity, social support, dual identity and status) mitigate the impact of study-related stressors on the mental health of medical students who carry an inordinate stress burden. Methods: The data collection was based on a questionnaire (online and paper–pencil) which was distributed to medical students in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The sample (224 participants) consisted of 77.2% female and 22.8% male medical students (36.2% human medicine students (HMS) and 63.8% dental medicine students (DMS)). The questionnaire included graphical scales and standardized questionnaires. We investigated demographic data, study-related stressors (i.e. academic performance, clinical practice, faculty relations) and depressive symptoms as outcomes, and social identity, social support, dual identity and status as moderators. The analyses were performed using SPSS 25 for Windows. Results: We found significant positive associations between study-related stressors and depressive symptoms. While dual identity as well as social support by fellow students emerged as buffers in these associations, the other social resources did not. As regards status, it was found to work as a buffer only in HMS, who typically enjoy a significantly higher status than dental medical students. Conclusion: It is only social resources such as support from fellow students and dual identity, but not other resource types, that can be effective buffers against depressive symptoms associated with study-related stressors. These findings can be used to promote students’ identities in relation to both fellow students and the faculty, or the university as a whole, enabling students to better cope with stress and, thus, suffer less from depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the HMS, who ascribe a relatively high status to themselves, can use their status as a buffering factor in stressful situations, in which little can be done from the outside. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, assessment and treatment pose several obstacles for pediatric providers. A child who may have age-appropriate communication skills will still struggle to accurately report the presence, timing, and severity of symptoms. Reports from parents, caregivers, and teachers are often subjective and can focus on 1 aspect of the child’s behavior. Untreated, anxiety disorders have an adverse effect on a child’s functioning, and impairments in physical health, academic performance, and social competence can lead to lifelong consequences. Well-validated and rapidly administered screening tools can be used to gather data from schools and other resources to inform the diagnosis, guide treatment recommendations, and track improvements. Limited training on behavioral health diagnosis and fear of “black box warnings” have left many pediatric clinicians reluctant to prescribe medications. There are readily available practice guidelines for these medications, and data documenting the efficacy of these medications for children should encourage their use. © 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics.

It is thought that international students are more affected by this situation among university students who are prone to mental disorders. For this reason, the aim of the current study was to investigate depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and perceived social support among international students in North Cyprus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and perceived social support scores were compared between international students who stayed in Cyprus during the quarantine period and students who returned to their home countries and also the factors predicting depression, anxiety and stress scores among international students staying in Cyprus during the quarantine period were examined. The sample of the study included 262 students who were recruited using convenience sampling. A socio-demographic form, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Short Form, Revised University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale were used for data collection. The results revealed that during the lockdown the students mostly worried about their health, their families’ health and their academic performance. International students who stayed in Cyprus during the lockdown had higher depression and lower perceived family support scores than the international students who travelled back to their home countries and were there during the lockdown. The result of hierarchical linear regression indicated that length of stay in Cyprus, perceived support of significant other and stress were predictors which explained 73% of variance in depression scores. Gender, monthly income and stress were significant predictors of anxiety which explained 63% of variance and grade, significant other support, depression and anxiety were predictors of stress which explained 78% of the variance. The current study result highlight that universities and states should consider social support and protective mental health programs for international students. © 2022 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

These digital environments facilitate and encourage fundamental mechanisms of implicit learning from feedback as well as observation in an unprecedented way. I will discuss how these technology-based learning environments impact the mental health of their users, e.g., by linking negative online feedback to depression and following influencers to disturbed eating.

There is concern about the mental health of university students and other factors which affect academic outcomes particularly for subgroups such as international students. There are few cohort studies of the breadth of issues that can impact on mental health and academic outcomes for both local and international students. We conducted a baseline prevalence survey of students at a large Australian university covering health, academic, and social determinants of wellbeing. The purpose was to inform the university’s new student health and wellbeing framework with a view to follow-up to determine predictors of mental ill-health and academic outcomes in the subsequent year. In this paper we present the baseline prevalence data and report on selected mental health and health care access issues for local and international students. Methods: The entire university population as of April 2019 of over 56,375 students aged 18 or above were invited to complete the online survey. Questions explored eight domains: demographic characteristics, general health and wellbeing, mental health, risk taking behaviours, psychosocial stressors, learning and academic factors, social and cultural environment, and awareness of and access to health and wellbeing services. Records of academic results were also accessed and matched with survey data for a large subset of students providing consent. Results: Fourteen thousand eight hundred eighty (26.4%) students commenced our survey and were representative of the entire student population on demographic characteristics. Three quarters were aged between 18 to 25 years and one third were international students. Eighty-five percent consented to access of their academic records. Similar proportions of local and international students experienced symptoms of a depression or anxiety disorder, however international students were less aware of and less likely to access available health services both inside and external to the university. We also reported on the prevalence of: general lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, amount of daily sleep); risk-taking behaviours (including alcohol, tobacco and other drug use; unprotected sexual activity); psychosocial stressors (financial, intimate partner violence, discrimination, academic stressors, acculturative stress); subjects failed; resilience; social supports; social media use; and health services accessed online. Conclusions: This rigorous and comprehensive examination of the health status of local and international students in an Australian university student population establishes the prevalence of mental health issues and other psychosocial determinants of health and wellbeing, along with academic performance. This study will inform a university-wide student wellbeing framework to guide health and wellbeing promotion and is a baseline for a 12-month follow-up of the cohort in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The current study sought to explore these stressors and challenges; examine how they relate to help-seeking, service access, and utilization; and recommend what colleges and universities can do to better support the mental health of student-athletes. Three focus groups were conducted with NCAA Division I student-athletes in upstate New York between November 2019 and October 2020. Student-athletes described significant stress juggling athletic, academic, and social demands while maintaining a performance level that met the expectations of their coaches and themselves. Student-athletes were also impacted by an unhealthy athletic culture and team environment, specific higher-risk transition periods, and inaccurate beliefs about student-athletes held by their non-athlete peers. While many athletes reported struggling with their mental health, they felt either unable or unwilling to seek help due to stigma, how it would appear to their coaches, the hours and location of the counseling center, and previous poor experiences accessing and utilizing services.

Participants were randomized to CR (CR; n = 7; 0.1 g·kg −1·day −1 CM +0.1 g·kg −1·day −1 corn-starch maltodextrin) or placebo (PL; n = 6; 0.2 g·kg −1·day −1 corn-starch maltodextrin) for 42 days. Pre- and post-testing included body composition, total body water (TBW), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, Diet History Questionnaire, the National Institute of Health Toolbox fluid cognition battery and isokinetic strength, vertical jump, medicine ball throw, and Wingate anaerobic power test. CR demonstrated a significant increase in TBW (pre, 32.2 ± 3.5 kg; post, 32.7 ± 3.6 kg; p = 0.024) and lean mass (LM; pre, 39.8 ± 3.6 kg; post, 41.5 ± 4.5 kg; p = 0.020). CR supplementation may be an effective strategy to increase TBW and estimates of LM in female collegiate dancers. Although this may optimize aesthetics, larger samples sizes with resistance training are needed to determine if CR supplementation increases muscle mass and translates to improved performance. © 2023 The Author(s).

The American College Health Association collects information on undergraduate students’ habits, behaviors, and perceptions of various health topics through the National College Health Assessment-II (NCHA-II) survey. This cross-sectional study utilized the Spring 2019 NCHA-II survey data from 55,284 respondents across 58 Canadian post-secondary institutions. Of this, 31,091 undergraduate students (56.2%) reported being stressed within the past year and were included in our analysis. Nine factors were selected from the questionnaire based on their relevance to social capital in the literature, and an additional seven socio-demographic factors were controlled for in subsequent analyses. The associations between these predictor variables and stress impacting students’ academic performance were examined by fitting univariable and mixed-effects logistic regression models. Our study found having warm and trusting relationships with others, feeling a sense of belongingness, and feeling society is a good place for all individuals significantly decreased the odds of students reporting stress impacting their academic performance. Campuses that support student mental health, institutions that provide information regarding stress reduction, and feeling safe on campus also lowered the odds of students reporting stress adversely affecting their academics. These components of social capital should be targeted at higher education institutions to cultivate social capital, alleviate the implications of stress affecting academic success, and promote interpersonal resiliency skill-building among students. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

These changes have considerable implications on the policy and the practice of academic confirmation in public universities. For new academic staff in one of the higher education institutions in Malaysia, they are required to successfully complete the Higher Education Learning and Teaching Course as one of the requirements for confirmation in the post. It is a good effort on the part of the university to provide knowledge and guidance to new academic staff and at the same time to support their academic development by providing continuous learning on teaching and learning activities. However, there were some concerns regarding the implementation of this course. Some academic staff faces problem due to stress and increased workload. Therefore, the objectives of this research are (i) to explore students‟ understanding of the Higher Education Learning and Teaching Course objectives, (ii) to identify the benefits and difficulties faced by the students during the course, (iii) to explore the impact of the course on new academic staff‟s teaching and learning activities, and finally (iv) to suggest recommendations to improve the delivery of the course for the benefit of all academic staff. Engaging in pure qualitative research (phenomenology and case study approach), this study methodology procedure was divided into three main stages, (i) library-based research for the collection of secondary data and reviewing them, (ii) fieldwork data collection in the form of an open-ended questionnaire with 18 respondents, and (iii) analysis of the open-ended questionnaire and documents for the purpose of reporting by using thematic analysis. The study found that the students believed that the purpose of the course is to enhance their teaching and learning skills as well as to produce a dynamic and holistic academician. It is undeniable that these students have benefited from this course in terms of knowledge transfer, teaching and learning a soft skill, and building a network which have left a positive impact on their teaching and learning activities. However, there were some difficulties with the heavy workloads during the course which has led to some students feeling demotivated and affecting their mental health. Finally, the study proposes revising the structure of the course by considering reducing the workload, revising the duration of the course, and review of some components in the staffs‟ yearly performance appraisal (key performance index (KPI)). The study also found that there is a need for effective communication between the management and academic staff regarding the policy for this higher education teaching and learning course. © 2022 Sciedu Press.

Few studies have attempted to link such issues with undergraduate medical education. This review aimed to advance the knowledge on this matter by exploring the relationship between mental wellbeing and medical professionalism in undergraduate medical education. Methods: We collected the literature about mental wellbeing and medical professionalism (published from 1 January 1986 to 31 March 2021) from the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and ScienceDirect databases using the search terms ‘mental wellbeing’ and ‘medical professionalism’.We included all peer-reviewed articles in which mental wellbeing and medical professionalism in the undergraduate medical education context were the central topics regardless of the age range, nationality, race and gender of the participants. Results: From the 13,076 Iinitially found articles, 16 were included. These 16 articles were from nine countries in four different continents, which all together helped us find answer to our research question using extracted points relating to the main study themes (mental wellbeing and medical professionalism). Under theme 1 (mental wellbeing), six subthemes emerged: burnout, stress, depression, disappointment, depersonalisation and conscientiousness. Theme 2 (medical professionalism), on the other hand, had five subthemes: empathy, academic performance, compassion, unprofessional behaviour and professionalism. A significant inverse association was found between empathy and burnout. Academic performance was also related to burnout. At the same time, empathy was found to have a varied association with stress. Moreover, compassion was found to alleviate burnout and nurture professional gratification. Conclusion: The medical professionalism attributes were found to deteriorate as the mental wellbeing issues grow. This can harm medical students’ overall health, current learning abilities and future attitudes towards their patients.

Furthermore, mental health issues and sleep problems were reported to be highly prevalent among medical students and physicians, and were found to be associated with worse academic and clinical performance in these populations. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep to examine the associations between sleep quality and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and to explore the possible mediating role of sleep in the relationship between psychological distress and HRQoL itself in a sample of medical and dental students attending a large Italian university. Participants (n = 407, mean age: 24.2 ± 2.4) answered an online questionnaire comprising the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Short Form-12 health survey. Up to 62% of the participants reported poor sleep quality. Controlling for psychological distress, sleep quality components were found to be associated with physical and mental HRQoL. Mediation analysis showed that overall sleep quality mediated all the single associations between anxiety, depression, and stress and HRQoL. These preliminary findings suggest that the quality of sleep is important for the well-being of medical students and that targeting sleep issues in this academic population may be beneficial. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The school serves an exclusively non-white, working-class student population who demonstrates the motivation and potential to attend and graduate from college. The school’s mission calls for its staff to be guided by cura personalis, meaning they will care for the whole person; yet data show that the school’s students were extremely stressed and that much of their stress was attributable to homework. This study sought to determine if reducing the amount of homework could improve students’ mental health without negatively impacting academic performance. Across ten sampled classrooms, teachers reduced the amount of homework they were assigning by 50% for a period of at least three months with an aim of reducing students’ self-reported levels of stress by 30% while maintaining academic performance. At the conclusion of the project, the number of students reporting high to moderate levels of stress decreased by nearly 30%. The school intends to expand this pilot to the entire school to effectively measure both mental health and academic performance outcomes at the school population level. The pilot data indicated that reducing homework school-wide would relieve a significant amount of stress for St. Patrick’s students while ensuring their academic performance remains steady. © 2023, Loyola Marymount University.

The QoL of university students can be affected by a variety of factors. Here we reviewed the QoL of college students and its associated factors. Methods: PubMed and CNKI were searched and 73 related studies were finally included. Key Content and Findings: The QoL score of college students was low in the “mental health” domain. Factors that may affect the QoL of college students included demographic factors (including gender, age, religion, ethnicity, urban/rural origin, family income, only child status, family type, and parent-child relationship), physiological factors (including musculoskeletal pain and chronic diseases), psychological factors (including anxiety/depression, social phobia, attention deficit disorder, and neglect/abuse during childhood), social factors (including left-behind experiences), lifestyle and behavioural factors (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and exercise), and academically relevant factors (including major, interest in learning, academic stress, and academic performance). However, most of the currently available studies on the QoL were conducted on medical students and therefore their findings could not be generalized to college students in other majors. Furthermore, most of them were cross-sectional studies, and the causal relationships between the above-mentioned factors and QoL need to be further explored in longitudinal studies. Conclusions: The QoL of non-medical college students and the “mental health” QoL of college students warrant further investigations. The QoL of college students is the result of a combination of demographic, psychological, physiological, behavioral, and academically relevant factors and should be improved by the adoption of multidisciplinary interventions. © AME Medical Journal.

This study aims to examine the correlation and predictive value of academic stress on mental health in undergraduate university students. A representative sample of 1,265 undergraduate university students from a private university in Bolivia was assessed using Pearson’s correlation analysis to determine the predictive value of academic stress on mental health. To validate the measurements obtained, a stepwise Hierarchical Multiple Linear Regression analysis was applied. A probability model was estimated to identify academic stressors that contribute to the probability of students experiencing Languishing Mental Health. The study revealed that Self-inflicted Stress was the most significant stressor among undergraduate students. This indicates that students’ self-demands and self-efficacy perceptions are essential factors in the development of high academic stress levels. There is a clear correlation between high levels of academic stress and the probability of experiencing Languishing Mental Health. © 2023 The Author(s).

Despite strong indications of heavy consumption of these substances, certain sections of the student population remain unexplored regarding their consumption patterns and associated factors, including research scholars pursuing Doctor of Philosophy degrees. This study aims to explore the patterns and correlations of consumption of alcohol and tobacco among doctoral students in three Indian universities. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 530 scholars from three central universities, Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University and Jawahar Lal Nehru University, and focused on two substances (alcohol and tobacco) frequently used by students in India. Bi-variate analysis and penalized logistic regressions were applied to analyse the prevalence and associated factors of alcohol, smoking and smokeless tobacco among doctoral students. Findings: Tobacco consumption was observed to be the dominant form of substance use among doctoral students. Findings revealed that 34% of scholars smoked and 25% consumed smokeless tobacco daily and around 14% consumed alcohol at least once a week. Major significant correlates of substance consumption among scholars were found to be gender, religion, parental mortality, dissatisfaction with academic performance and stress about future career/employment. Significant variation in substance use patterns was observed among universities. Originality/value: This study provides first-hand evidence on substance use patterns and the correlates among doctoral students in three Indian universities. Findings indicate the implementation of specific intervention programs for mental health and counselling for this section of students to prevent substance use addiction would be beneficial. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Specifically, the sector made up of university students has suffered an abrupt change of teaching modality because of the pandemic. As such, this paper aims to analyze the impact that COVID-19 has had on different personal factors of students: (i) satisfaction with life; (ii) lived uncertainty; (iii) depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as factors related to academic development; (iv) motivation and the creation of teaching and learning strategies during this period; and (v) the perception of the degree of adaptability to the new scenario brought about by the university system. For this purpose, a cross-sectional quantitative design was advocated through the elaboration of an SEM model, which included 1873 university students from Andalusian Universities (Spain). The results reflected the strong negative impact that the pandemic had, especially on the levels of life satisfaction and the indices of depression, anxiety, and stress of the students. Likewise, the findings reflected the relevance of the correct adaptability on the part of the university to these new circumstances.

Religiosity and spirituality are common in Muslim countries and are usually used as a means of coping strategy for psychological and mental disorders. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the association between religious actions, depressive symptoms, and stress among students of nursing education lasting 3 years and students from the first 3 years of medical education lasting 7 years. The study was conducted at Ibn Zohr University of Agadir, Morocco. Method: A sample of different stages of nursing and medical students was recruited. Religiosity was assessed by Muslim Belief into Action (M.BIAC) scale. The depressive symptoms and stress were, respectively, assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Results: Four hundred and thirteen students participated in this study. Our results showed a high prevalence of depressive symptoms (62.2%) and stress (66.8%). The depression scores were higher in the following subsample categories: students in the first 2 years of studies, female medical students, and nursing students with significant differences. The recorded religiosity was greater among students without depression compared to students with depression (p < 0.001). In the multivariate regression, the BIAC score demonstrated religiosity as neither a risk factor nor a protective factor of depression. Conclusion: Religiosity constitutes a protective factor of depression and stress among nursing and medical students. This should improve the student's ability to cope with stressful situations during their training. Prospective studies are needed to further investigate this association and how religiosity improves mental health. This would contribute to improved academic performance and wellbeing among medical and nursing students.

Medical students experience high stress levels that should be managed promptly to prevent stress-related impacts on students’ health and education. Aim: This study aims to identify the relationship between stress factors, general health, and academic performance. Methods: This study recruited 421 medical students of all academic years. Participants completed an online survey assessing stress levels using a validated 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. Stress was also compared with students’ health and academic performance. Results: We found that 93.6% of our sample experienced moderate to severe stress, and 31% reported increased stress due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Except for internship students, stress significantly decreases as students progress each academic year (p < 0.05). Students with higher GPAs and with comorbidities are more stressed. Comorbidities were primarily reported in students in their final years of education with a 4% lower GPA than healthy students. Although we had three stress-related themes (general, academic, and pandemic), students’ perceptions of stress factors were primarily academically related. Conclusions: Students experience high stress levels in their final educational years, which might increase the risk of health issues and low academic performance. It is essential to innovate stress-coping strategies specially designed for medical students and mandatorily provided by all medical colleges and to educate students on the effects of stress on their health. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The present study aimed to identify the factors associated with anxiety, depression, and stress in students at a university in Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We conducted a cross-sectional analytical study in students in Lima, Peru. The DASS-21 scale was used to measure levels of depression, anxiety, and stress and associate it with socio-educational and COVID-19-related variables using generalized linear models with Poisson distribution, log link, and robust variance. Of 400 students surveyed, 19.2%, 23.2% and 17.2% of students presented depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. The frequency of depression (PR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.84–0.99), anxiety (PR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.83–0.99) and stress (PR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.86–0.99) was lower in women.

Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed a semistructured interview that focused on their experiences with mental health. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim via Zoom. Credibility and trustworthiness were established via member checking, triangulation, and peer discussion among a 3-person coding team. Results: Two domains, increased expectations and resources and management, were identified. The participants shared how they balanced life as a college student, academic stressors, performance expectations, and a sport-first mindset they perceived from coaches and support staff. They discussed their experience with the internal support network of coaches, the athletic department, and sport psychology. Participants remarked on their external support network, which included their family, friends, and psychological services. The resources available at their institutions and their accessibility were perceived both positively and negatively. Some collegiate SAs described resources as helpful, whereas others portrayed a lack of timeliness for appointments, lack of advertisement, incomprehension by counselors of athlete demands, and no sport-specific counseling as barriers. Conclusions: Collegiate SAs expressed mental health concerns due to stress and the demands of sport participation. Self-regulated coping strategies and support networks continue to be powerful and helpful resources for mental health, with or without a diagnosed condition. Barriers to mental health service use were a lack of sport specificity and lack of access. Institutions need to focus on creating athlete-centered mental health resources with annual advertisements to increase use. © 2023 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

Medical education systems during the COVID-19 pandemic have met unprecedented challenges that have influenced medical students. This study aimed to explore the effects of psychological resilience, stress, and smartphone addiction on academic burnout among Chinese medical students. Material/Methods: This study utilized a cross-sectional design, from March 13, 2022 to March 31, 2022, within the Wannan Medical College, where students completed a web-based survey. The Chinese version of the Academic Burnout Scale (ABS), the 10-item Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) were used in this survey. Data entry and analysis were conducted using IBM SPSS ver. 22.0. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to examine the correlations between medical college students' academic burnout and smartphone addiction and mental health. Binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to evaluate the factors influencing academic burnout. Results: Of 3190 medical college students who completed the survey, 1521 (47.7%) had some degree of academic burnout. Gender, being a student leader, grades, perceived stress, and smartphone addiction were associated with the total score of academic burnout. Psychological resilience and adapting to online classes were protective factors against academic burnout. Conclusions: Academic burnout is common among medical college students in China after the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is urgent to address this situation to improve the quality of medical education. © 2023 International Scientific Information, Inc..

Yet, there is limited evidence on the lived experiences of sexual harassment from school-based settings in sub-Saharan Africa. We explore students’ perceived experiences, perpetration, and drivers of sexual harassment in schools in Mwanza, Tanzania. This study employed a qualitative research design involving 30 in-depth interviews and seven focus group discussions with 30 male and 40 female secondary school pupils aged 13–19 years. Data was analysed using a thematic approach. The findings show that experiences of sexual harassment among schoolgirls were widespread. Common forms of harassment were verbal and non-verbal gestures of a sexual nature. The desire to prove one’s masculinity and peer pressure were key drivers of perpetration among schoolboys. Teachers took advantage of their positions of authority to sexually harass female pupils and employed corporal punishment to those who resisted their advances. Sexual harassment had multiple negative outcomes, including schoolgirls dropping out of school and mental health issues, such as anxiety, stress and poor academic performance. Girls rarely reported sexual harassment for fear of further victimisation and stigma from others. Sexual harassment of girls is common in secondary schools in Mwanza and is mainly driven by peer pressure and the desire to prove one’s masculinity. Given its harmful effects, there is a need to implement clear policies to protect girls, support confidential disclosure and reporting and to address toxic masculinity norms among young men. © The Author(s) 2022.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Using national survey data across China, this study examines how children’s psychological well-being (PWB) and academic performance differ across commute duration and mode among urban, rural, and urban fringe areas. Our findings show that commute times are significantly negatively associated with children’s PWB and academic achievements, and this correlation varies across areas. Children living in the urban fringe have the longest average one-way commuting time (18.6 min), but they have a better acceptance of longer commuting duration, whereas commuting time is more influential in the city center and rural areas. Regarding travel mode, walking to school is positively associated with PWB in the center area, while bicycles and public transport positively affect the rural student scores. Results from quantile regression show that students on the lower quantiles of the conditional distribution of PWB tend to suffer more than the others when commuting time increases; students with middle scores respond similarly to marginal changes in commuting time. Recommendations for urban planners and policymakers to enhance child WB include fostering school-home balance, improving public transit services, and investing in pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure for those vulnerable groups. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Mental health problems affect students’ health. They affect many areas of a student's life, affecting the quality of life, academic performance, physical health and negatively affecting relationships with friends and family. These problems can affect future employment, income potential, overall health, and can also have long-term effects on the students. Early detection can help them before they go into depression and offer remedial measures that might help to relieve stress. Unfortunately, there is no real-time technique for automatic, continuous, consistent, and reliable stress detection at an early stage. We provide a new framework for instantaneous stress detection. This framework detects hu-man stress based on facial expressions, facial cues (stress score), and breathing patterns (respiration rate). Facial expressions of anger, disgust, fear, and sadness are all signs of stress. The distance between eyebrows and lip movement can also be used as stress indicators. Data on breathing patterns is critical for mental health analysis because it can detect early signs of stress and depression. Skeletal tracking with an Intel depth-sensing camera is used to collect this data. Finally, a machine learning model is built on the collected multimodal data to accurately predict stress levels in multiple subjects. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

They’re thinking: ""Why not just whack me now, rather than wait to see those ratings again."" This book takes off from the premise that student ratings are a necessary, but not sufficient source of evidence for measuring teaching effectiveness. It is a fun-filled--but solidly evidence-based--romp through more than a dozen other methods that include measurement by self, peers, outside experts, alumni, administrators, employers, and even aliens. As the major stakeholders in this process, both faculty AND administrators, plus clinicians who teach in schools of medicine, nursing, and the allied health fields, need to be involved in writing, adapting, evaluating, or buying items to create the various scales to measure teaching performance. This is the first basic introduction in the faculty evaluation literature to take you step-by-step through the process to develop these tools, interpret their scores, and make decisions about teaching improvement, annual contract renewal/dismissal, merit pay, promotion, and tenure. It explains how to create appropriate, high quality items and detect those that can introduce bias and unfairness into the results.Ron Berk also stresses the need for “triangulation”--the use of multiple, complementary methods--to provide the properly balanced, comprehensive and fair assessment of teaching that is the benchmark of employment decision making.This is a must-read to empower faculty, administrators, and clinicians to use appropriate evidence to make decisions accurately, reliably, and fairly.

Ideological and political educators in colleges should help college students to relieve anxiety and pressure in a timely manner, and constantly put forward effective and targeted methods. This paper analyzed the reasons for the anxiety of college students from three aspects: the way of dealing with the interpersonal relationship of college students, the degree of emphasis on college students’ academic performance, and the way of college students’ self-decompression. This paper proposed ways to strengthen the ability of thinking, carry out setback education, and improve the psychological quality of college students to realize the Marxist ideological and political education in colleges. This paper mainly used questionnaires and in-depth interviews to analyze the influence of mental health education courses on college students’ anxiety management ability. Among them, after the end of the mental health education course, a questionnaire was distributed to the selected research subjects to understand their stress management ability status after the course. Through the analysis and comparison of the results of the two questionnaires before and after, as well as the comparison of the conventional teaching methods of college students’ mental health education different from the teaching methods of group psychological counseling, it is necessary to understand the way college students’ deal with anxiety. The study found that 19.23% of the students had great anxiety about interpersonal communication problems, and 9.62% of the students reported that they had no major anxiety problems. Therefore, Marxist ideological and political education in colleges has become an important means for college students to vent their emotions, relieve psychological pressure and avoid adverse consequences.

The collapse of the Soviet Union caused economic instability, unemployment and poverty resulting in labour migration. Since then, thousands of children have been left behind in the care of extended family members while their parents work abroad. The aim of this study is to explore schoolteachers’ perceptions on parental migration and left-behind children (LBC) in Georgia as schoolteachers are the main contact persons for LBC and their caregivers. Methods: We conducted six focus-group discussions with public school teachers, namely class-tutors and six in-depth interviews with school principals from two migrant sending regions. We applied reflexive thematic analysis to systematically analyse the data and identify main and sub-themes. The contextual model of family stress underpins this study. Results: We identified the following themes expressed by both, teachers, and school principals: social and economic impact of migrant labour and relationships between schools and migrant families. School teachers and principals acknowledged some positive aspects of migrant labour, but primarily perceived parental migration as a negative experience for children leading to problems in mental health, well-being, and academic performance. Structural factors, lack of support and lack of community involvement were expressed to further worsen the situation. Teachers saw themselves as one of the main supporters for LBC while they described the role of caregivers ranging from caring to unhelpful or even destructive. School principals stated mitigating the situation by regular meetings with class tutors, extra-tutoring for LBC, psychological counselling, and developing/enacting internal guidelines. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that LBCs and transnational families could benefit from the provision of psychological services at schools. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

As an alterable individual variable that influences stress consequences, stress mindset has attracted academic attention recently. However, the relationship between stress mindset and adolescents’ responses toward exams has not been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate whether stress mindset affected pre-exam mental health status and exam performance, and whether appraisals of exam mediated such influence. We collected stress mindset, threat and challenge appraisals, pre-exam mental health status, and exam scores from 185 Chinese 11th-grade students. All of them would take an important and unified exam organized on the school level. Results showed that the stress-is-enhancing mindset negatively predicted students’ symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, but had no direct effect on performance. Further mediation analysis showed that stress-is-enhancing mindset was positively associated with the challenging appraisal and was negatively associated with the threat appraisal, thus having better health status (including fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress) and performance. These results suggest that the stress mindset had an association with students’ response toward exams, and how they appraised the upcoming exam would be an important indirect pathway. Future studies may benefit from changing students’ mindsets to protect them from negative consequences of exam stress. © 2022 Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Consequently, we argue that there is an urgent need to reassess the supervisory process to support doctoral students in addressing these concerns. This paper offers a potential solution to this challenge by exploring and examining how integrating coaching methods into doctoral supervision can support doctoral students’ growth and development, thereby increasing their wellbeing and human flourishing. Coaching aims to help individuals produce optimal performance and improvements in personal and professional settings by deploying a series of tools and models. Coaching is essentially a non-directive form of development, enabling people to identify goals and skills and then extracting the capacity people have within themselves to achieve their ambitions. This paper explores how coaching methods could be made a regular feature of doctoral supervision. Background The need to reconfigure doctoral supervision as a practice to address humanistic issues regarding whole-person development, self-actualisation, and personal worth is nothing new. Over the years, researchers have produced models of doctoral supervision, highlighting the growing need for supervision to incorporate more pastoral and emancipatory elements, which facilitate personal growth instead of focusing purely on academic function and criticality. Although coaching is identified in previous studies as being a valuable addition, nothing examines how to modify existing supervision practices to accommodate more pastoral elements. Methodology This paper offers a conceptual analysis whereby the argument primarily synthesizes existing research on doctoral supervision to understand why coaching methods may provide a solution to the evolving requirements of student welfare and emancipation. Since the commentary in this paper is not based on the findings of an empirical study, the following two conceptual research questions frame the discussion. First, are coaching methods beneficial when supervising doctoral students? Second, what are the challenges when implementing and integrating coaching methods into existing doctoral supervisory practice? The paper utilises the Normalisation Process Theory as a ‘thinking tool’ to help answer these questions. The theory evaluates phenomena in applied social research settings to help understand how complex practices are made workable and integrated into context-dependent ways. Therefore, the theory acts as an analytical tool, enabling researchers to think through implementation issues when designing complex interventions and their evaluation. Contribution This paper contributes to knowledge by highlighting ways in which management responsible for a doctoral provision in higher education settings can modify their organisational structures and systems to encourage coaching methods to become a normalised part of doctoral supervision, thereby legitimising its practice. Findings The Normalisation Process Theory has value because it produces a roadmap for integrating and implementing new or modified practices into existing systems of operation. It, therefore, assists by producing an output that enables a current/new practice to be dissected and categorised under specific headings. In this research context, this output assisted in understanding the operational challenges when considering the normalisation of a practice. The theory helped generate something managers tasked with managing doctoral provision could consider (i.e., institutional paradigms, policies, regulations, etc.) when thinking about what may need to be reconfigured to enable coaching methods to become an integrated and normalised part of doctoral supervision over time. Recommendations It is recommended that practitioners consider the integration of coaching methfor Practitioners ods into supervision. First, once implemented, it requires monitoring to ensure the practice’s quality and consistency amongst the supervisory community. Secondly, to assess the impact of the practice on other services within the organisation, such as student services or faith services, and thirdly, to ensure training in coaching methods is made timely and relevant to assist all academics involved in doctoral supervision. Recommendations The authors recommend collecting empirical evidence using the Normalisation for Researchers Process Theory to evaluate the integration and normalisation of a range of practices in higher education settings. Moreover, once implemented, more research is required on the long-term value of coaching methods within doctoral settings. Impact on Society Doctoral education is increasingly significant in a world where knowledge is fundamental to generating economic growth. Identified as having the technical and professional skills needed to fuel the knowledge-based economy, student wellbeing, and mental health must be optimal to ensure they can contribute to the knowledge-based economy as effectively as possible. Future Research More research must be conducted on how doctoral supervision can become more humanistic; for example, by focusing on student self-awareness, reflection, and reframing instead of just the traditional academic function. Consequently, improving these facets is vital in developing sustained wellbeing and life-long success. © 2023 Informing Science Institute.

The effects can be felt in universities and schools, shifting their learning to online platforms. However, medical schools bear the burden of protecting students and ensuring the continuation of the education process. The rapid transition to online learning, coupled with the lack of preparation from the educational system, leads to stresses that affect students' academic performance, mental health and social life. Nevertheless, no review tried to synthesise the complete picture of the pandemic's effects. Therefore, this scoping review aims to identify and explore the available literature on the effects or impacts of the pandemic on medical students without limiting it to specific dimensions. Methods This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews and the Joanna Briggs Institute manual for evidence synthesis. We examine articles reporting data from any country. However, only articles written in English will be included. For studies to be included, they must report any form of impact on medical students, qualitatively or quantitatively. Furthermore, the impact must occur within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Searches will be done on Medline, EMBASE, ERIC, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycInfo. After data extraction, we will narratively synthesise the data and explore the types of impacts COVID-19 has on medical students. Ethics and dissemination No formal ethical approval is required. The scoping review will be published in peer-reviewed journals and as conference presentations and summaries, wherever appropriate.  © 2022 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

However, to date, no studies have evaluated these three disorders among high school students in Africa. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and their associated factors among high school students in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 849 participants from six high schools in Northwest Ethiopia. A self-administered Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 25.0 software to identify factors associated with DAS, and bi-variable and multi-variable analyses were performed. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 41.4, 66.7, and 52.2% respectively. Being female (AOR = 1.304, 95% CI = 1.006–1.849), higher risky khat chewers (AOR = 5.595, 95% CI = 2.357–11.132), having social phobia (AOR = 1.416, 95% CI = 1.045–1.919) were associated with depression. Being higher risky cigarette smokers (AOR = 4.777, 95% CI = 1.407–7304), having a history of chronic medical illness (AOR = 2.099, 95% CI = 1.045–4.218), and having a family history of mental illness (AOR = 1.777, 95% CI = 1.028–3.073) associated with anxiety. Stress was associated with high-risk alcohol drinkers (AOR = 1.828, 95% CI = 1.012–3.303), rural residency (AOR = 1.395, 95%CI = 1.010–1.925), and low social support (AOR 1.7391, 95% CI = 1.203–2.515). Conclusion: The burden of DAS among high school students was found to be high. Female sex, chewing khat, and having social phobia are associated with depression. Conversely, smoking cigarettes, having a chronic medical illness, and having a family history of mental illness are all linked to anxiety. Being a highly risky alcoholic drinker, having poor social support, and being a rural resident are positively associated with stress. Therefore, extending mental health services to all high schools, and strengthening the existing counseling services, are recommended. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

COVID-19 abruptly moved education away from the classroom and mandated that instruction take place either in a small classroom setting or remotely on digital platforms, it added to the already stressed climate. Though it is established that pandemics pose stress and stress affects food intake and academic performance, little has been explored in relation to COVID-19 pandemic induced stress, diet alteration, mental health, and dietary behaviors among university students in Ghana. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on diet alteration, dietary behavior, mental health, and academic performance among the students of the University for Development Studies. In this cross-sectional study design (n = 94), an online survey was conducted among undergraduate students of the University for Development Studies. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. According to the study's findings, all participants had different levels of stress, poor mental health, and problematic eating behaviors. About six out of every 10 students experienced stress induced by COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half of the students altered their diets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Majority of the students were also engaged in problematic eating behaviors. Additionally, academic performance of students was heavily influenced: Students who reported worse academic performance were about eight times more likely to be stressed due to COVID-19 pandemic compared to students who reported no change to their academic performance. Our findings suggest that students of UDS experience variety of pressures which were compounded by COVID-19. There is a need for programs that improve stress levels, mental health, and food intake in the university setting.  © 2023 Clement Kubreziga Kubuga et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was applied, and only the depression domain was verified. A structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic, behavioral, and COVID-19 pandemic-related fear variables. Academic performance was assessed based on academic records, ranging from 0 (worst possible grade) to 10 (best possible grade). Respondents included 408 regularly enrolled dental students. Bi and multivariate analyses were performed using Poisson regression with robust variance to verify the association between at least moderate depressive symptoms and independent variables. Results: The prevalence of at least moderate depression was 40.5% among undergraduate students and 26% among graduate students. The prevalence of fear and anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 96.1% among undergraduate students and 93.5% among graduate students. In the final multivariate analysis, being female (prevalence ratio [PR]:2.01; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]:1.36–2.96) was associated with a higher PR for depression. Conversely, no exposure to smoking (PR:0.54; 95%CI:0.36–0.82) and a final academic performance average ≥7.0 (PR:0.56; 95%CI:0.41–0.76) was associated with a lower PR for depression. Finally, among graduate students, a non-heterosexual orientation was associated with a higher PR for depression (PR:6.70; 95%CI:2.21–20.29). Conclusion: Higher rates of depression symptoms were observed in female undergraduates, students with lower academic performance and smoking exposure, and graduate dental students with a non-heterosexual orientation. © 2022 The American Phytopathological Society","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

It is a critical transition into adulthood whereby heightened risk-taking and sensation-seeking takes place, such as substance abuse. In a South African context, this transition sometimes occurs under economic stress, poverty, unemployment, high levels of crime and political instability. This can place adolescents at risk of substance abuse. Objectives: To explore and describe the lived experiences of adolescents abusing substances in the Greater Giyani Municipality in the Limpopo province, South Africa. Method: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design with a phenomenological approach was used. Data were collected through individual, in-depth, phenomenological interviews and field notes. Thematic coding was utilised to analyse the collected data, and literature was reviewed to support the findings. Moreover, measures to ensure trustworthiness and ethical principles were applied throughout the research process. Results: Five themes were identified: substance abuse behaviour among adolescents, adolescents’ motivation for continuing substance abuse, the effects of substance abuse on the lives of adolescents, factors affecting adolescents’ discontinuation of substance abuse and a need to discontinue substance abuse. Conclusion: The study concluded that adolescents abusing substances in the Greater Giyani, Limpopo province, experience loss of control, broken relationships, poor academic performance, stigma attached to mental illness and negative emotions. The adolescents foresaw their future as uncertain and without direction. It is recommended that mental healthcare professionals introduce and implement interventions that will assist the adolescents who abuse substances in the Greater Giyani, Limpopo province. Contribution: The findings in this study could add knowledge in developing and implementing of strategies for psychiatric nurses to support adolescents abusing substances in the Greater Giyani, Limpopo province. © 2023.

Girls, in particular, are more reactive towards stressful events, leading to an increased prevalence of internalized mental disorders. Therefore, the present study was intended to explore slow-paced breathing as a mental health and well-being promoting tool for young female volleyball players, while considering its feasibility in an organized sports setting. Twenty-two athletes ranging in age from 15 to 17 years (M = 15.86, SD = .83) from the under-16 and under-17 teams in the same volleyball club were assigned to the experimental (EG) and control group (CG). The EG performed an 8-week, 5-min, guided slow-paced breathing protocol, whereas the CG (n =12) followed an extended warm-up routine conducted by a coach while the breathing session was taking place. Pre-and post-intervention questionnaires with self-report measures of trait anxiety, perceived stress, positive and negative affect, subjective happiness, life satisfaction and perceived performance were administered, coupled with weekly measurements consisting of a CO2 tolerance test. Results suggested that, except for positive affect, all psychological and well-being markers showed no significant differences when compared to the control group after the intervention, as well as when comparing pre-and post-intervention periods within the EG. Nevertheless, overwhelmingly positive qualitative reports and significant improvements in CO2 tolerance may imply that some effects of the slow-paced breathing intervention took place in relation with the short session duration and/or intervention length. Future studies should further explore simple, accessible interventions such as this one to address the onset of mental disorders and/or daily stress in a sports setting. © JPES.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, recent studies have shown that women are more likely to be affected by stress than men. Excessive pressure or performance expectations at work are believed to lead to stress. Emotional, physical, and mental symptoms and indicators are all part of this reaction. Office stress develops when demands on employees are greater than their ability to cope with them. Because women being female, their career objectives can be influenced. It can be difficult for women to advance their careers and careers as doctors in various faculties because they lack the inner motivation to overcome the many challenges that stand in their way, identification of protective factors for resiliency and overcoming the barriers for women to achieve their academic success beside their family and life responsibilities. Objectives: To assess work related stress parameters among a group of female postgraduate staff workers, train them to mitigate stress by workplace mental health promotion program and test its feedback. Subjects and Methods: A-Assessment of stress among study group at a baseline using Workplace Stress Model, which measure 5 parameters. B-Measurement of stress hormone (cortisol) in the study group. C-Training and application of workplace health promotion program for 3 months before reassessment of work stress and compare its results. Results: Improvement of work stress parameters and cortisol level was detected after application of the WorkProMentH's Program among participants. Conclusion: Working staff women are vulnerable to workstress.

The study's goal was to determine whether autosuggestion can enhance academic achievement and lessen exam-related stress in secondary school students. On 58 secondary school students, this interventional study was carried out over the course of a year. Six months before to the exam, a validated questionnaire called the Perceived Stress Score was used to analyse their sense of exam-day stress (PSS). Just prior to the exam, saliva was taken in order to estimate cortisol levels, which were then evaluated using ELISA. GraphPad Instat version 3 was used to conduct the statistical analysis. The Wilcoxon rank signed test was used to compare grades and stress perception scores. The Chi square test was used to determine the relationship between cortisol levels and academic performance in students, and the Spearman correlation test was used to determine correlations. A statistically significant difference between the PSS in pupils before and after autosuggestion was discovered (p = 0.0002) Significant differences in the grades obtained before and after autosuggestion were found (p 0.0001). Cortisol levels and grades did not have a statistically significant relationship (p=0.4477), and the chi square statistic was 0.5766. In our study, autosuggestion led to lower stress levels and higher academic performance. Higher cortisol levels indicated a 50% lower likelihood of earning good grades, pointing to a link between academic achievement and the stress marker. A successful autosuggestion regimen increased the likelihood of reducing stress by 85%. © 2023 International Scientific Organization. All Rights Reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The educational system has undergone significant transformation as some activities have abruptly moved from on-site to online. Researchers' curiosity about how the transitional period affects students' learning and well-being has grown during this time. This study intends to assess how King Faisal University students perceive the effects of switching from traditional classroom instruction to online learning on their academic performance and psychological well-being. Methods: A total of 915 male and female students from King Faisal University in the Al-Ahsa Governorate participated in the survey. The Students' Perception of Online Learning Questionnaire (51) and the Psychological Well-Being Questionnaire (52) was used to gather data from students at King Faisal University (all colleges). E-learning and face-to-face learning were compared by percentage and T-test to address the research concerns. Results: The findings of this study revealed that students rated face-to-face learning 375 (41%) as a more acceptable way of learning in comparison to the e-learning method 320 (38%). Students rated access to online materials 186 (20%) as the main advantage of the e-learning method, whereas technical problems 312 (34%) were the main disadvantage of e-learning. There was a statistically significant relationship between students’ psychological well-being in response to e-learning and face-to-face learning method, specifically autonomy (t=10.13, p=.002), personal growth (t=21.19, p=.000), and social relations (t=34.64, p=.000).

This was followed by an online, in-depth, one-to-one interview among 10 female undergraduates who reported severe musculoskeletal pain. The two sets of findings were integrated using a triangulation protocol. Result: The three most common musculoskeletal pains experienced by undergraduates due to online learning were low back (73.2%), followed by neck (68.7%) and shoulder (58.7%) pain. The six main themes identified from the interviews were: (1) Musculoskeletal pain characteristics; (2) academic issues; (3) difficulties faced by undergraduates due to teaching and learning; (4) emotions towards work/study; (5) work environment; and (6) time spent working at a workstation. Upper back pain was identified to be associated with personal (p < 0.05) and most environmental factors (p < 0.05). From the triangulation model, it was shown that personal, academic stressors and environmental factors were mainly from the workstation, uncomfortable environment, working posture and time spent at the workstation, which all contributed to musculoskeletal pain. Conclusions: This study showed that exercise, academic stressors, and environmental factors were associated with musculoskeletal pain among undergraduates due to online teaching and learning sessions. There may be a need to integrate an online prevention of musculoskeletal pain education package based on a biopsychosocial model with online teaching and learning for undergraduates. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Many students face overwhelming stress and anxiety when participating in different activities and interacting with peers, which can affect their performance and mental well-being. However, many are unlikely to seek or receive help. Intelligent agents can offer the possibility of delivering health and mental well-being interventions with the aim of extending and complementing mental health interventions and increasing accessibility. To provide efficient interventions for students, it is imperative to identify design elements and functionalities that are most effective for engaging students. In this paper, we conducted an online survey with 85 participants (undergraduate and graduate students) to investigate preferences for using intelligent agents (e.g., conversational agents, social robots, etc.) to support their mental well-being, specifically to deal with feelings of stress and anxiety in social situations that are common in academic contexts. We asked students to complete a questionnaire in order to explore students' experience of anxiety and their perceptions of different aspects of intelligent agents in the context of managing anxiety. The results provide insights on different social and technical capabilities as well as design elements that need to be considered when developing intelligent agents to help address stress and anxiety among university students. © 2022 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

The authors got their primary data from 30 undergraduate university students (17 males and 13 females) who willingly responded to one-on-one and face-to-face semi-structured interviews. The authors used the grounded theory analysis approach and thematic analysis to analyze the data. The study results show that lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and increased levels of students’ stress, anxiety, frustration, boredom, anger, and well-being issues among university students, which, in turn, have negatively influenced students’ academic performance. The results also show several other factors that have contributed to the student’s declining academic performance including lack of academic help, absence of socialization, scarcity of physical activities, and worries about getting an admirable job. In addition, this study develops a conceptual framework for the relationship between COVID-19, levels of students’ stress, anxiety, frustration, boredom, anger, and well-being of university students’ academic performance. The newly developed model illustrates how researchers can anticipate academic dwindling performance, specifically their GPAs during the pandemic. Researchers can use this study benchmark for further qualitative and quantitative research studies. Moreover, the study outcomes could be used as approaches for policymakers, university administrators, and faculty members when considering exams, homework, and assignments. Finally, the study results could help administrators consider other non-temporary and cosmetic solutions such as a pass/fail option to keep the students’ GPA not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

Existing research has indicated that this teaching mode is perceived negatively by many college students. The difficulty students encounter in emergency online learning can adversely affect their mental health and academic performance. To shed further light on how emergency online learning may have impeded college students’ academic functioning and adjustment, this study examined the association between online learning stress and academic coping and the mediating roles of academic self-efficacy and academic hope. It was conducted in early 2021, a year after the outbreak of the pandemic. Ninety-nine Chinese college students in Hong Kong were recruited and they completed an online questionnaire for this study. Results showed that online learning stress was negatively associated with approach academic coping and social support seeking, and the associations were mediated by academic hope. On the other hand, online learning stress was positively associated with avoidance academic coping, which was not mediated by academic hope. The mediation effects of academic self-efficacy were all non-significant. In sum, college students used more passive and maladaptive coping to handle academic problems when they experienced more online learning stress, and this was partly explained by lower levels of academic hope. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

As one of the most important research directions for insomnia, adolescent insomnia has significant research value, social value, and practical significance. Unfortunately, there is no bibliometric analysis in this field of study. This study aims to analyze published articles using bibliometrics, summarize the current research progress and hot topics in this field systematically and exhaustively, and predict the future direction and trend of research. Methods: For this study, the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database was searched between 2002 and 2022 for publications related to adolescent insomnia. The R–bibliometrix, VOSViewer, and CiteSpace software were utilized for bibliometric analysis. Results: This investigation included 2468 publications from 3102 institutions in 87 countries, led by China and the United States. This field of research has entered a period of rapid development since 2017. The journal with the most publications on adolescent insomnia is Sleep, which is also the most co–cited journal. American Journal of Psychology has the highest impact factor among the top 10 journals. These papers were written by 10605 authors; notably, Liu Xianchen emerged as the author with the highest frequency of publications, while Mary A. Carskadon was the most frequently co–cited author. Mental health and comorbid diseases were the main research directions in this field. “Depression,” “anxiety,” “mental health,” “COVID–19,” “stress,” “quality of life,” “heart rate variability,” and “attention–deficit hyperactivity disorder” were hot spots and trends in this field at the current moment. Conclusion: The research on adolescent insomnia has social value, research value, and research potential; its development is accelerating, and an increasing number of researchers are focusing on it. This study summarized and analyzed the development process, hot spots, and trends of adolescent insomnia research using bibliometric analysis, which identified the current hot topics in this field and predicted the development trend for the future.

Ongoing efforts to better educate and equip athletic trainers to help student-athletes in this regard should result in improved mental health—related outcomes. Objective: To examine changes in the mental health of student-athletes over the past decade compared with that of nonathlete students. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Colleges and universities in the United States. Patients or Other Participants: Varsity athletes (athletes; n ¼ 54479) and nonathlete students (nonathletes; n ¼ 448301) who completed the National College Health Assessment between 2011 and 2019. Main Outcome Measure(s): Surveys included responses (self-reported) to questions in 5 mental health—related categories: recent mental health symptoms, recent mental health diagnosis, mental health treatment-seeking behavior, receiving mental health information from the institution, and the recent effect of mental health factors on academic performance. Results: Athletes consistently described lower symptom and diagnosis rates compared with nonathletes, except for attempted suicide, substance abuse, and eating disorders. Rates of diagnosis increased over time in both groups but remained lower in athletes. Treatment-seeking behavior and openness to future treatment increased over time in both groups but remained lower in athletes. Athletes received more information on stress reduction, substance abuse, eating disorders, and handling distress or violence compared with nonathletes. Both groups received information more frequently over time. Athletes reported fewer academic effects, especially for depression and anxiety, but these effects grew over time in both groups. The effects of injuries and extracurricular activities on academic performance were greater in athletes than in nonathletes. Conclusions: Athletes described overall lower levels of mental health symptoms, diagnoses, and academic effects compared with nonathletes. Whereas the rates in nonathletes climbed over the past decade, the rates in athletes broadly remained flat or climbed less rapidly. Increasingly positive attitudes toward treatment were encouraging, but the deficit in athletes relative to nonathletes persisted. Ongoing efforts of athletic trainers to educate athletes and guide them to mental health resources are needed to continue, or better yet to accelerate, the observed positive trends in information dissemination and treatment-seeking behavior. © by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 535 adolescents aged 13 to 14 on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia using online surveys from February 2021 to April 202. Mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and parental or guardian supervision, connectedness, bonding, respect for privacy, physical activity, and risk behaviours were asked using the Malaysian Global School-based Student's Health Survey. Multiple logistic regression analysis was done to examine the associations of the variables. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress were 28.2%, 38.1% and 18.5%, respectively. Adolescent with low parental/guardian connectedness and bonding were associated with depression (AOR = 3.82, 95% CI =1.80 – 8.08), anxiety (AOR 2.17,95% CI = 1.34 – 3.50) and stress (AOR 2.29, 95% CI = 1.13 – 4.65). Low parental supervision (AOR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.19 – 4.54), low academic performance (AOR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.10 – 11.62), stress (AOR = 8.56, 95% CI = 4.38 – 16.70) and anxiety AOR = 7.83, 95% CI = 4.48 – 13.70) were predictors for depression.

This study aims to highlight the daily rhythm desynchronization and examine the mental health of Moroccan students who were impacted, notably females, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIAL: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in May 2020 at ten Moroccan faculties including 312 students with an average age of 22 ± 1.70 years old, processed according to a random sampling. A Daily Activities Biorhythm Questionnaire was used to assess the students' daily activities time use and duration, while the PTSD Symptom Scale, Hamilton Scale, Worry Domains Questionnaire, and Visual Analog Mood State Scale were used to assess their mental health. A statistical analysis used both Chi-square and t test to evaluate the relationship between females and males as two independent groups to the studied variables. RESULTS: Based on individual gender differences, a significant disruption emerged in the daily time use and duration of activities during home confinement. Besides, females were more likely to experience psychological issues notably anxiety (2.04 ± 0.49), physical tiredness (2.11 ± 0.39), sadness (p <.05), and posttraumatic stress disorder (p <.01). In contrast, there is a strong correlation between males' concern of declining employment (p <.05) and their worry of declining family budgets (2.10 ± 1.39). CONCLUSIONS: As an emerging behavior for a new risk factor, the daily activities rhythm of Moroccan university students have been altered and mental health difficulties have appeared due to the quarantine isolation. This might influence their overall academic performance and psychological balance. In this instance, psychological assistance is highly recommended. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The majority of prior studies were cross-sectional and thereby failed to capture the individual changes in mental health over time. Moreover, few studies have explored whether and how socioeconomic and education backgrounds could be related to college students’ mental health changes. This study aimed to fill these gaps. Methods: Data were from a nationwide, two-wave panel survey of college students in China. Baseline information was collected in November 2019, i.e., before the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. A follow-up survey was conducted in November and December 2020, when the epidemic was effectively contained in mainland China. In both waves, mental health was assessed with the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). The between-wave changes in psychological distress were measured and categorized. Results: Overall, 13.5% of students experienced at least a one-standard-deviation increase in psychological distress over the one-year follow-up. Results from both bivariate and multivariable analysis showed that this marked distress increase was more pronounced among vocational college students (vs. academic undergraduate and postgraduate students) and those with lower levels of academic performance. In contrast, family socioeconomic status (as measured by parental education, family economic condition, and current residence) was not associated with distress changes over time. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of the educational disparities within the higher education system in understanding the mental health dynamics of college students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Therefore, this study aimed to gain a greater understanding of how community actors perceive meaningful leisure time and how they work to create meaningful leisure time with the intention of increasing the chances for more adolescents completing upper secondary school. Semi-structured interviews with 14 informants, representing nine different community actors in a middle-sized city in Sweden, were conducted and analysed using content analysis. Results suggest that meaningful leisure time positively impacts adolescents’ mental health through social relations, support, and guidance. Leisure is believed to have spillover effects on reducing stress, manage school demands and performance. Nevertheless, leisure time activities and school performance must be balanced with time and effort. Community actors work proactively with availability, individual approaches, and offering activities to create meaning. From a societal perspective, places to hang out with supportive adults, in particular structured activities, should be regarded as a social investment in adolescents’ health and prospects, especially in deprived areas where fewer activities are available. Finally, ensuring meaningful leisure time is in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study aimed to assess the prognostic performance of these four scores to predict long-term outcomes (≥ 2 years) in adult cardiac arrest patients. Methods: This is a prospective single-centre cohort study including consecutive cardiac arrest patients admitted to intensive care in a Swiss tertiary academic medical centre. The primary endpoint was 2-year mortality. Secondary endpoints were neurological outcome at 2 years post-arrest assessed by Cerebral Performance Category with CPC 1–2 defined as good and CPC 3–5 as poor neurological outcome, and 6-year mortality. Results: In 415 patients admitted to intensive care, the 2-year mortality was 58.1%, with 96.7% of survivors showing good neurological outcome. The 6-year mortality was 82.5%. All four scores showed good discriminatory performance for 2-year mortality, with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.82, 0.87, 0.83 and 0.81 for the OHCA, CAHP, APACHE II and SAPS II scores. The results were similar for poor neurological outcome at 2 years and 6-year mortality. Conclusion: This study suggests that two established cardiac arrest-specific scores and two severity-of-illness scores provide good prognostic value to predict long-term outcome after cardiac arrest and thus may help in early goals-of-care discussions. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

As teachers facilitate the learning process and are expected to support students emotionally, Muldong, Garcia & Gozum (2021) suggest that work-from-home teachers should be provided with psychosocial support to address the mental and emotional stress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. El-Monshed, El-Adl, Ali and Loutfy (2021) and Carreon & Manansala (2021) suggest that educational institutions should also take measures to improve students’ mental health and academic performance and make it a priority in the current context. This paper reports the findings of a project on psychosocial support at Blaze Koneski Faculty in Skopje from March to June 2021 involving 15 language and translation teachers and 121 students. The teachers attended a series of workshops guided by a trained clinical psychologist. The workshops aimed at providing immediate psychosocial assistance to teachers to cope with the stress of the pandemic, to sensitise teachers to the students’ needs in an emerging crisis and to empower them to employ new ways of student engagement in the online classroom. The training concept was based on the assumption that one’s self-care and well-being are prerequisites for one to be able to care about others (in this context the students). The teachers tested various methods at two levels of classroom communication. They engaged in informal communication and introduced well-being techniques to create a relaxing class atmosphere and to facilitate the learning process. They also involved students in participative activities to help them take hold of their learning. Teacher and student feedback has been positive and points to the encouraging effect of this approach in the online environment and beyond it. It shows that the modern translation classroom, be it physical or virtual, requires giving students an active voice and a sense of control over their learning. It also shows that moving away from adhering to technical material to enrich the curriculum with topics and methods that address well-being and mental health is beneficial. © 2023 by University of Niš, Serbia.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The culture of competition and assessment has resulted in increasing stress levels amongst medical students, causing a decline in their academic performance and overall mental health. The objective of this qualitative analysis was to characterize recommendations from educational experts to aid students’ academic progress. Methods: At an international meeting in 2019, worksheets were completed by medical educators during a panel discussion. Participants responded to four scenarios representing common challenges medical students face in school (eg. Postponing Step 1, failing clerkships, etc.). For each case, participants addressed what students, faculty and medical schools could do to mitigate the challenge. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted by two authors followed by deductive categorization using an individual-organizational resilience model. Results: Across the four cases, common suggestions made for students, faculty and medical schools were aligned to a resilience model representing the complex interplay between individuals and organizations and the impact on student wellbeing. Discussion: Using suggestions from medical educators from across the US, we were able to identify recommendations for students, faculty, and medical schools to help students succeed in medical school. By applying a model of resilience, faculty serve as a critical bridge to connect students to the medical school administration. Our findings also support a pass/fail curriculum to ease the competition and burden students place on themselves. © 2023 The Author(s).

Our study aims to update knowledge about psychological distress and its impact on healthcare students in Poland after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by intense and political instability in Europe. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on healthcare students from Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland, from March to April 2022. The questionnaire included subjective retrospective 5-point Likert-scales ratings of anxiety, stress, and depression and self-reported information on various psychological distress predictors. Results: The anxiety levels at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic were higher than in April 2022. There was no significant reduction in stress and depression. Females had higher initial anxiety levels than post-pandemic levels. Higher reported levels of anxiety, stress, and depression were significantly correlated with political instability in Eastern Europe (Spearman ranxiety = 0.178, rstress = 0.169, rdepression = 0.154, p ≤ 0.001, respectively). The concern about moving towards online education showed a significant association only with stress level (rstress = 0.099, p = 0.034). We also observed a positive correlation between anxiety, stress, and depression and deteriorating sleep quality (Spearman ranxiety,=0.325, rstress = 0.410, rdepression = 0.440, p < 0.001), the feeling of worsening relationships with family and peers (ranxiety = 0.325, rstress = 0.343, rdepression = 0.379, p < 0.001), and the sense of loss of efficient time management (ranxiety = 0.321, rstress = 0.345, rdepression = 0.410, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Throughout the progression of the Ukrainian war and the COVID-19 pandemic, females reported improved (lower levels) levels of anxiety. Nevertheless, the current levels of self-reported anxiety post-pandemic remain alarming, while stress and depression levels remained unchanged. Mental, psychological, and social support activities are required for healthcare students, especially those away from their families. Time management, academic performance, and coping skills in relation to the additional stressors of war and the global pandemic require further research in this group of students.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether expressive writing (EW) can help high test-anxious individuals reduce the degree of the CUP effect, and whether the intervention effects were different in people with different working memory capacities. (2) Methods: High test-anxious participants wrote expressively (EW group) or neutrally (control group) according to guidance, and then completed a modular arithmetic (MA) task under a high-stress condition. (3) Results: The state anxiety score of the control group was significantly higher than that of the EW group in the high-pressure situation, indicating that the EW intervention was helpful to alleviate the state anxiety. Subjects with high working memory capacity in the control group performed the complex MA task significantly less accurately in the high-stress situation than in the low-stress situation, showing the CUP effect. There was no significant difference in complex MA task scores between high- and low-stress situations for subjects with high working memory capacity in the EW group, indicating that the EW intervention can reduce the degree of the CUP effect.

Since the beginning of this century, psychosocial competencies have been defined as the ability to develop positive mental health. Most individual or social mental health protection programs are related to psychosocial competencies. A majority of evidence-based programs that develop mental health explicitly aim at developing psychosocial competencies, either exclusively or with complementary approaches. Many of these programs have demonstrated their effectiveness, with lasting effects on reduced anxiety and depression symptoms, violent and risky behaviors, and improved well-being and academic success. Based on international meta-analyses and on 20 years of French national and local experiences, a national strategy to develop psychosocial competencies was launched in France in 2021 for all children from 3 to 25 years old. Two reports on evidence-based psychosocial competence development were published in 2022 by the national agency for public health—Santé publique France (Public Health France)—to support this deployment strategy and develop a common evidence-based culture in health and education. This article presents the French national strategy as an example of a means of increasing evidence-based mental health promotion while discussing the importance of cultural adaptation of such programs. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The pandemic effect has led to the spiraling of mental disorders among young people who will be the next generation of leaders. This study aims to identify university students’ sociodemographic, psychosocial and academic backgrounds and performance associated with depression symptoms for the development of primary and secondary preventive strategies for mental health. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed to 19 institutions in Malaysia offering a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree program. The self-rated Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42) was used to assess depression symptoms. Pearson’s chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used to assess the investigated variables with depression symptoms. Independent T-test and one-way ANOVA were used to compare means of depression score across variables. Binary logistic regression was employed to examine the relationship between the investigated variables and depression symptoms. A total of 610 pharmacy students participated, of which 47% (n = 289/610) were having depression symptoms. Students who smoke nicotine and those who have separated parents, family history of mental illness, and poor academic performance were associated with depression symptoms (p < 0.05). Differences in geographical areas, race and religion also showed significant associations with depression symptoms. Parental marital status, poor academic performance, history of mental illness and comorbidities were statistically predicting depression symptoms (p < 0.05). Primary preventive strategies allowing students to harness healthy coping skills for stress, nicotine-free campaigns and a holistic curriculum are warranted. Secondary measures on mindfulness and compassion skills activities to benefit students who experienced early life crises are highly recommended. Enforcing these targeted strategies in collaboration with health and social sectors should be the primary agenda of universities to ensure their uptake. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Research suggests that psychological techniques of persuasion may be effective in reducing stress and improving mental health, and therefore may be beneficial techniques to utilize in engineering classrooms. There are six primary persuasion techniques: reciprocity, liking, social proof, scarcity, commitment, and authority (coercive and expert). These are used to build relationships, increase motivation, and manage decisions during uncertainty. The objective of our study was to evaluate the relationship between engineering students' perceptions of their professors' use of persuasion and the students' self-reported academic and mental health outcomes. We hypothesized that methods that enhance community and improve sense of belonging (reciprocity, commitment, liking, social proof) would lead to better academic and mental health outcomes, and methods associated with negative professor attitudes (coercive authority) would lead to poor academic and mental health outcomes. The data partially supports the hypotheses, with various student academic and mental health outcomes significantly improving with higher use of liking, social proof, commitment, and expert authority, and worsening with higher use of coercive authority. The results suggest that by using liking, social proof, expert authority, and commitment in the classroom and decreasing coercive techniques, professors can improve student grades and mental health. © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Materials and methods: This study analyzed 50,858 subjects (male: 26,535 subjects, and female: 24,323 subjects) between 12 and 18 years old. Outcome variables were classified into two classes (normal or obesity) based on body mass index (BMI). The explanatory variables included demographic factors, mental health factors, life habit factors, exercise factors, and academic factors. This study developed a model for predicting adolescent obesity by using multiple logistic regressions that corrected all confounding factors to understand the relationship between predictors for South Korean adolescent obesity by inputting the seven variables with the highest Shapley values found in categorical boosting (CatBoost). Results: In this study, the top seven variables with a high impact on model output (based on SHAP values in CatBoost) were gender, mean sitting hours per day, the number of days of conducting strength training in the past seven days, academic performance, the number of days of drinking soda in the past seven days, the number of days of conducting the moderate-intensity physical activity for 60 min or more per day in the past seven days, and subjective stress perception level. Conclusion: To prevent obesity in adolescents, it is required to detect adolescents vulnerable to obesity early and conduct monitoring continuously to manage their physical health.

These techniques can be applied very efficiently for the development of various sectors, including the solution of mental health issues among students, especially in sports education. The proposed article is a summary and analysis of existing intelligent approaches employed to safeguard against numerous mental health issues during the academic journey of a learner. With the utilization of smart methodologies, it is very feasible to compute the stress or depression level of a student and improve academic performance and skills. With innovative technologies, it is possible to accurately analyze behavioral features and recognize any unwanted pattern for the timely detection of mental health issues. To assist the learners in becoming responsible citizens, it is very efficient to utilize AI for the improvement of their psychological quality and mental performance by reducing anxiety and depression levels. Smart methods can be applied for the recognition of personnel in educational sectors who are facing difficulties in performing their duties and can be motivated to enhance their mental level. The investigation then gathered several significant qualities from the literature already in the field and chose the most prevalent ones.

Our study utilized a machine learning approach to examine the degree to which students’ college adjustment and coping styles impacted their adjustment to COVID-19 disruptions. More specifically, we developed predictive models to distinguish between well-adjusted and not well-adjusted students in each of five psychological domains: academic adjustment, emotionality adjustment, social support adjustment, general COVID-19 regulations response, and discriminatory impact. The predictive features used for these models are students’ individual characteristics in three psychological domains, i.e., Ways of Coping (WAYS), Adaptation to College (SACQ), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), assessed using established commercial and open-access questionnaires. We based our study on a proprietary survey dataset collected from 517 U.S. students during the initial peak of the pandemic. Our models achieved an average of 0.91 AUC score over the five domains. Using the SHAP method, we further identified the most relevant risk factors associated with each classification task. The findings reveal the relationship of students’ general adaptation to college and coping in relation to their adjustment during COVID-19. Our results could help universities identify systemic and individualized strategies to support their students in coping with stress and to facilitate students’ college adjustment in this era of challenges and uncertainties. © 2022 Zhao et al.

Although many studies have analyzed sleep phenomenology among this population, only few have focused on insomnia and its related variables. In addition, such studies do not always include a clinical interview or a specific and validated instrument for measuring insomnia. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of insomnia symptoms and the relationship between insomnia and health habits, mental health, and academic performance in a large university student sample. Methods: Five hundred and eighty-two students were recruited from the University of Granada, Spain. Data were collected through an online survey with questions on sociodemographic and academic data and health habits as well as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Sleep Hygiene Index, and Sleepiness, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales. A multiple regression analysis explored the relationship between academic performance, health habits, mood state, and insomnia symptoms. Results: The prevalence of students with symptoms of insomnia was high (39.7%). A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that depression, sleep hygiene, stress and anxiety were significant predictors of insomnia symptoms. Multivariate analyses revealed that subjective insomnia symptoms, sleep efficiency, and depression were significantly correlated with academic performance in a dependent way. Conclusions: In university students, anxiety, stress, and poor sleep hygiene are risk factors for insomnia, which plays an important role in academic performance. Promoting sleep and mental health could be a potentially effective way to improve their academic performance. © 2022 by the authors.

We analyzed the autonomic stress response, cortical arousal, subjective distress perception, and the sense of objective and subjective academic fulfilment of 84 single-degree physiotherapy students and 26 double-degree sport sciences and physiotherapy students during their bachelor’s thesis defense. The results showed that the bachelor’s thesis defense was a stressful event for double-degree students, showing an activation of the sympathetic nervous system and presenting a higher autonomic habituation response for the double degree students compared to the single degree students. We found higher mean grades during the whole degree and higher grades in the written and oral bachelor’s thesis academic achievements for single-degree students compared to double-degree students. No significant differences were found between single-degree and double-degree students in subjective distress perception and cortical arousal. No correlation was found between academic performance variables and subjective distress perception, cortical arousal, and autonomic modulation variables. We conclude that the bachelor’s thesis defense pro-duces a large anticipatory anxiety response in single-degree physiotherapy students and in double-degree sport sciences and physiotherapy students. Double-degree students showed higher levels of habituation and adaptability to the stressful event, with a better autonomic response.

While these create challenges for all staff, they potentially impact most on non-academic staff, due to long standing misunderstanding and undervaluing of their roles and despite them representing almost half of all jobs within the sector. In this context, leaders’ abilities to manage emotions in the workplace appear to be at a premium. However emotionality remains under-explored both generally within HE and in non-academic contexts particularly. This article summarizes findings from research into the impact perceptions of managers’ abilities to display Emotional Intelligence (EI) has on the wellbeing, attitudes and performance of staff within the context of a professional services team in one English university. It found perceptions of managers’ EI could be a powerful influence on team members’ mental health, including stress and anxiety. Furthermore, when managers were viewed as being Emotionally Intelligent, staff reported this significantly impacted their motivation and could lead to tangible improvements in core areas of job performance, including commitment, flexibility and discretionary effort. It recommends Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) consider placing greater emphasis on developing understanding of EI throughout their workforce while also building capacity in its practice amongst current and prospective managers. © 2022 British Educational Leadership, Management & Administration Society (BELMAS).","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: An online anonymous survey assessed the prevalence of probable mental health disorders (MHDs) and impact of blast-related and other factors controlling for sociodemographics in 801 children aged 8 to 17 years old. Results: About two thirds (64%) were screened positive for probable anxiety using the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Disorder, 52% for probable PTSD using CRIES-13, and 33% for probable depression using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Children who resided farthest way from the explosion site or were not in Beirut during blast had a significantly lower odds of anxiety and PTSD. Children who sustained any physical injury (vs. none) or witnessed casualties (vs. not) were at higher odds for PTSD. Children of parents who reported that their homes sustained minor damages (vs. no damages at all) were at higher odds for anxiety and PTSD, and temporary displacement (vs. none) increased odds of PTSD only. Poorer perceived economic status, poorer academic performance, having a family member injured in the blast, and prior mental health care seeking were associated with higher odds for all MHDs. Conclusion: Our study, the only one to document the mental health impact of the Beirut Port explosion on children, highlights the critical need for an emergency mental health response, prioritizing disadvantaged communities and children with prior mental health problems. © 2022","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The literature acknowledges a wide range of risk factors that cause psychological distress, while at the same time emphasizing the role of social support as a protective factor. On the other hand, feelings of unsafety as a possible source of psychological distress have been so far largely overlooked in the literature. Objective: The present study explores the consequences of a specific stressor (feeling unsafe) and asks whether social support can act as a moderator in the association between subjective unsafety and psychological distress. Methods: A multi-group structural equation model was run with a sample of 2876 young adolescents aged 10–12 enrolled in educational centers in the city of Barcelona, Spain. Results: The results show that direct exposure to sibling violence at home and bullying at school are significant predictors of psychological distress, regardless of biological sex. The hypothesis of a negative correlation of subjective perceptions of unsafety on psychological distress is also supported, although neighborhood-based risk factors emerge as a greater source of distress for females than for males. The involvement of supportive adults is associated with lower levels of perceptions of unsafety and distress in both groups, but girls seem capable of drawing more effectively on alternative sources of support, specifically their peers, to enhance their safety at school and in the neighborhood. Conclusion: Overall, gender differences in our model overlap with socio-environmental inequalities (low income, exposure to violence and conflictual public spaces), thus suggesting that an intervention into the root causes of these inequalities could contribute to lowering psychological distress in early adolescence. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for injury in adolescent female football players. Methods and analysis The Karolinska football Injury Cohort (KIC) is an ongoing longitudinal study that will include approximately 400 female football academy players 12-19 years old in Sweden. A detailed questionnaire regarding demographics, health status, lifestyle, stress, socioeconomic factors, psychosocial factors and various football-related factors are completed at baseline and after 1 year. Clinical tests measuring strength, mobility, neuromuscular control of the lower extremity, trunk and neck are carried out at baseline. Players are followed prospectively with weekly emails regarding exposure to football and other physical activity, health issues (such as stress, recovery, etc), pain, performance and injuries via the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Overuse Injury Questionnaire (OSTRC-O). Players who report a substantial injury in the OSTRC-O, that is, not being able to participate in football activities, or have reduced their training volume performance to a moderate or major degree, are contacted for full injury documentation. In addition to player data, academy coaches also complete a baseline questionnaire regarding coach experience and education. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Authority at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden (2016/1251-31/4). All participating players and their legal guardians give their written informed consent. The study will be reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology. The results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and disseminated to the Swedish football movement through stakeholders and media. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Nevertheless, many patients with CKD do not adequately engage in self-management behaviors, and little is known on the underlying reasons. We aimed to identify and describe the factors that influence self-management behaviors from the perspective of adults with CKD. Methods: We conducted 30 semistructured interviews with adults with CKD stage 3 or 4 from an academic nephrology clinic in the United States. Interviews were analyzed thematically. Results: The following are the 3 key phases of CKD self-management behavior engagement identified: (i) prioritization, (ii) performance, and (iii) maintenance. Prioritization was favorably influenced by optimism, stress management, and patient-provider communication and hampered by fatalism and competing priorities. Behavior performance was facilitated by motivating factors, self-efficacy, and support resources and impeded by comorbid conditions that caused treatment burden and adverse symptoms. Behavior maintenance relied on effective routines, influenced by similar factors as behavior performance, and reinforced by memory aids, goal setting, self-monitoring, and proactive preparation. Conclusion: We identified modifiable facilitators and barriers that influence the incorporation of CKD self-management into daily life. Our findings have important implications for the care of patients with CKD by providing a framework for providers to develop effective, tailored approaches to promote self-management engagement. © 2021 International Society of Nephrology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Closure combined with forced online distance education (FODE) was a cure with many side effects, 1 of them being the effect on students' mental health and, more specifically, levels of stress. Due to the novelty of the situation, there have been no studies so far designed to link satisfaction with online study, feelings toward the study obligations, and stress among students. Objective: The aim of the study is to assess the perceived stress of Slovenian postsecondary students in order to identify the online study-related factors affecting or acting as a covariate during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: Data collection was conducted through a self-reported survey as part of a large cross-sectional study based on data collected from postsecondary students from a number of higher educational institutions. The random sample consisted of 4455 individuals. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), Satisfaction with Online Study Scale (SAT-5), and Feelings Towards Study Obligations Scale (FETSOS) were used to assess the constructs and the relations observed within the study. Results: The results indicate that more than half of all respondents reported high levels of stress. The difference in the reported levels of perceived stress between genders were statistically significant (N=4454, F2=56.719, P<.001, Cohen d=0.35). Overall, the results suggest that a decline in the motivation to study, the quality of internet and mobile connections, and the presence of distracting factors in the study space were the 3 main factors related to the students' negative emotions as associated with the timeliness, performance, and quality of the study obligations. Furthermore, the results show that the level of satisfaction with online study affected stress such that the higher the satisfaction, the lower the stress. Moreover, the more positive feelings connected with the timeliness, performance, and quality of the study obligations that the students felt, the more satisfaction they reported with online study and, thus indirectly, lower stress and less negative feelings. Conclusions: The findings of this study call for implementing structures and measures targeted at stress reduction, working conditions, and pedagogy with regard to FODE. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

While screening for social determinants of health is recommended, there is little evidence that identifying social risk early in life predicts longer-term poorer outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which assessing social risk using a standardized tool in young children up to age 6 years might predict poor health and academic performance at 10–11 years old. The social risk domains studied were housing instability, food insecurity, financial strain, transport problems, safety, lack of support and unemployment. The predictive validity of these social risk domains measured at 0–5 years was examined using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Outcomes at 10–11 years included ongoing diseases and mental health conditions, hospitalization, injury, dental problems, overweight or obesity and academic achievement. Financial strain and inability to access support were the most sensitive measures of poor outcomes. Across all social risks, the positive predictive value was highest for academic outcomes. Across all domains, there was higher sensitivity for children with 2 or more social risks. Items in the social risk screening tool were moderate predictors of academic outcomes, but weak predictors of health outcomes at 10–11 years.

The study operationalized the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model which is a sociological framework used to predict occupational-related health outcomes. The basic theory of ERI model assumes that an imbalance of effort and reward predicts adverse health outcomes. Methods: The research involved two studies, Study I (n = 833) to quantitatively measure ERI and Study II to collect qualitative data (n = 44) on the drivers of ERI among university students. In Study I, a modified Arabic version of the ERI questionnaire was used. The study measured ERI and investigated the reliability and validity of the Arabic version of the ERI model questionnaire. In Study II, data were collected from focus groups and personal interviews and thematic analysis was used. Results: The results suggested that ERI was associated with poor academic performance (OR=2.31, 95% CI 1.60–3.32), absenteeism (OR=1.66, 95% CI 1.21–2.27), low exercise level (OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.49–2.74) and poor self-reported health (OR=1.12, 95% CI 1.08–1.30). Three major themes emerged, namely high academic load, financial pressures and negative influence on the students' performance, wellbeing and health to explain effort-reward imbalance. Conclusions: Results suggest that ERI among university students is multi-faceted and is not bound only to academic-related demands and that the extrinsic factors such as the economic context of Jordan is among drivers of ERI.

ACE exposure has been connected with poor academic performance, poor health outcomes, and certain diseases. However, there is still relatively little known about the prevalence and impact of ACE exposure in early childhood. Using the 2016 National Survey of Children’s Health, this study assessed the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences for children under the age of six years. This research measured the impact of individual ACEs on health and developmental outcomes and found that financial hardship and parental mental illness both had increased odds of having health and developmental difficulties. Furthermore, this work finds that there is a dose-response relationship between ACE count and increased risk of health and developmental difficulties. Conversely, children who were reported as affectionate with their parent had decreased risk for health and developmental problems. Programs supporting families with young children should focus efforts on enhancing quality of attachment, especially for children experiencing ACEs. © The Author(s) 2022.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Data were collected through an online survey about the measures to address the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers. Healthcare professionals, researchers, and academics were invited to respond to the survey. Fifty-six professionals from 35 countries contributed data to this study. Ten countries (28.6%) reported that they did not launch any national interventions. Both developed and developing countries launched similar initiatives. There was no relationship between the existence of any type of initiative in a country with the incidence, lethality, and mortality rates of the country due to COVID-19, and per capita income in 2020. The 24 h hotline for psychological support was the most frequent intervention. Tools for self-rescue by using apps or websites were extensively used, too. Other common interventions were the development of action protocols, availability of regular and updated information, implantation of distance learning systems, early detection of infection programs for professionals, economic reinforcements, hiring of staff reinforcement, and modification of leave and vacation dates. © 2022 by the authors.

Methods: An observational study with a cross-sectional design was performed. Students of health sciences (medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, psychology), and non-health sciences (biology, social sciences, business management, and engineering) undergraduate programs completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS). Students’ grades for the first semester were collected. Results: A sample of 506 students participated. Prevalence of psychological distress was 27.1% and burnout was 7.3%. Academic performance was unaffected in relation to either psychological distress or burnout. Non-health sciences students showed a greater risk of depression. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of the high prevalence of psychological distress in the first year of college.

Moreover, some studies have reported that the above two issues affect each other. In Iran, limited studies have been conducted in this field. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim to determine the frequency of poor sleep quality and mental health problems among medical students and the association between these two variables. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, which was conducted from January to April 2021, 320 medical students of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, Iran) participated. Sampling was performed through the stratified method based on gender and educational phase. Data was collected using an online questionnaire including the following components: A researcher-made sociodemographic characteristics questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21). Results: The mean age of 320 participants was 22.95 ± 2.59 years and 145 (45.3%) were men. The percentage of medical intern participants (34.7%) was higher than that of basic science (34.4%) and medical extern (30.9%). The mean PSQI score was 8.11 ± 2.99, which shows overall poor sleep quality. The comparison between poor sleepers and good sleepers in terms of sociodemographic variables showed that only grade point average was significantly lower in poor sleepers (P = 0.049). The prevalence of some levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among participants was 100%, 100%, and 95.3%, respectively. There were also significant associations between poor sleep quality and all three components of mental health of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and stress (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Poor sleep quality and mental health problems are interrelated among medical students, and reduce their academic performance. The high prevalence of these problems indicates the importance of the issue, which requires immediate action by the authorities to decrease its consequences. © 2022, Vesnu Publications.

Accordingly, this research project intended to investigate the incidence of loneliness and its related risk factors among students studying at universities of medical sciences. Method: The participants in this cross-sectional study were 538 Tabriz University of Medical Sciences students, selected using a simple random sampling method. Loneliness was measured using the UCLA Loneliness questionnaire with 20 questions. Descriptive statistics, multiple logistic regression, and Chi-square were used to identify factors affecting loneliness. Results: The results showed that the mean loneliness score and the magnitude of the students' loneliness were 41.42 and 26.4%, respectively. The magnitude of loneliness was higher among female respondents (OR = 1.86, P = 0.005), cigarette smokers (OR = 0.39, P < 0.001), freshman students (OR = 2.76, P = 0.021), sophomore students (OR = 2.36, P = 0.040), those with low financial status (OR = 1.80, P = 0.037), and those residing in dormitories (OR = 1.73, P = 0.013). Conclusion: In general, loneliness was widespread among the students. Based on the findings, the magnitude of loneliness was higher among the first-year student group, female students, students with poor economic status, and those who smoked and lived in dormitories. Therefore, this study's findings underline the significance of making students aware of loneliness, investigating the circumstances and factors that exacerbate this sensation among first-year students (mainly between 18-21 years old), and devising intervention to alleviate it. © 2022 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

The results indicate negative and statistically significant associations between the dimensions of mental health disorders and university adjustment. In addition, there are differences in the study variables when contrasting groups with low and high academic performance, mainly regarding the dimensions of university adaptation related to career and study. Finally, we discussed the implications of the findings for the educational field and, above all, for the delivery of psychopedagogical guidance in higher education. © 2022 Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.

A consecutive sample of 192 fifth-year students was selected by convenience sampling method. They were examined using the medico-sociological and psychometric methods. There were 137 students of medical and 55 pedagogical students aged 20-29 years (Mean±SD=21.8±1.2 years; 142 women and 50 men). The participants completed the test for academic stress, social phobia inventory, Beck depression inventory-2, Beck anxiety inventory, and depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 (Lovibond, Lovibond). The obtained data were analyzed in SPSS software v. 16. Results: There are many differences between the mental health status of the study groups. These differences comprise suicide ideation, suicide attempt, depression, and symptoms of social phobia. However, there were no differences between study groups regarding anxiety, high academic load, and disappointment in the profession, and manifestations of educational stress, including fatigue and psychosomatic symptoms. The routine methods for overcoming stress were drinking alcohol (most often among medical students), smoking, and taking nonprescription sedatives, which was a risk factor for addictive behaviors. Discussion: It is necessary to develop and implement psychoeducational programs for medical and pedagogical students to acquire adaptive skills to overcome stress and reduce anxiety and depression, eventually preventing the development of psychosomatic disorders and addictions © 2022.

Due to the tough challenges faced by students during their academic life, severe issues of stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues emerge, which affect their academic performance and have a long-lasting impact on their future careers. The pandemic accelerates the stress levels, anxiety, and mental issues of students. The main purpose of this study was to explore how music education impacts on Students’ psychological wellbeing and academic performance. This study also investigates the mediating effect of self-esteem and self-efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, there has been little to no study exploring the relationship of music education on the psychological wellbeing and performance of students, especially from the perspective of Asian countries. This study was conducted in undergraduate and graduate institutions of China. This study was quantitative in nature and data were collected from 319 respondents. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was employed for data analysis. Results reveal that music education has a significant positive impact on psychological wellbeing, which improves Students’ academic performance. Moreover, psychological wellbeing also has a significant and positive impact on Students’ academic performance. Self-efficacy and self-esteem significantly mediate the relationship between music education and psychological wellbeing. The findings of this study open new avenues for future research in music education and psychological wellbeing. This study suggests that the policymakers and practitioners should make such policies that encourage educational institutes to adopt music education to improve the psychological wellbeing of students.

The main problems that the students face are depression, anxiety, stress, and fear. There may be many variables that cause such issues among students. Students may feel changes in normal cognitive functioning, behavior, emotions, and even physical functioning abilities. The impact of mental issues among students can be significant and it can lead to difficulties in studies, social withdrawal, and even suicidal thoughts. There is no sufficient awareness, resources, and support for students to manage the issues which cause mental issues. Methodology: This study is aimed to indicate the various factors that cause mental health issues among higher study students. For this purpose, we have reviewed 12 studies from well-known online web engines like Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct. The keywords employed to find such studies were:(""mental health crisis"" OR ""mental health problems"" OR ""mental health difficulties"") AND (""2010""[Date-Publication]: ""2023""[Date-Publication]) AND ""students “NOT (""other diseases"" OR ""medical conditions"" OR ""comorbidities""). All the studies included were in the English language and conducted by well-known institutions. Results: It was found that the major factors that are responsible for mental health crises among university students are academic stress, loneliness, financial pressure, sleeplessness, substance abuse, and abuse or trauma. There may be other such factors but these are the primary variables that cause anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts among university students. All educational institutions must devise proper policies to tackle unwanted situations like accidents, injuries, and even suicides. Students must be provided with sufficient awareness and mental health services in this regard. © 2022, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Museu de Zoologia.

Objectives: To assess the prevalence and correlates of depression, anxiety and stress among physiotherapy clinical students. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was employed on 402 physiotherapy clinical students aged 17–40 years using a convenience sampling method. The data were collected using the self-administered 42-items Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS) and the data were analysed using a Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among these students was 79.9%, 85.6% and 81.6%, respectively. The results indicate that financial status and social life influenced depression by 20.6% (odds ratio [OR] [95%] = 1.206 [1.110, 1.311]) and 36% (OR [95%] = 1.360 [1.050, 1.764]), respectively. Fear of repeating a class influenced anxiety by eight times (OR [95%] = 8.330 [6.643, 10.422]). Fear of repeating a class, financial status and academic performance influenced stress by eight times (OR [95%] = 8.360 [6.677, 10.470]), 17.5% (OR [95%] = 1.175 [1.083, 1.275]) and 18.1% (OR [95%] = 1.181 [1.083, 1.276]), respectively. Conclusion: Our study concluded that there was a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among physiotherapy clinical students. These outcomes suggest that more attention needs to be given to improving physiotherapy clinical students’ mental health, which will ultimately improve learning outcomes. Clinical implications: The long-term effects of psychological distress could potentially impact students’ academic performance. It may also have long-lasting effects after graduation. Therefore, students who are at risk of developing psychological symptoms are needed to be thoroughly examined and then receive early required interventions. © 2022.

Preliminary findings suggest that procrastination emerges due to dysfunctional emotion regulation efforts to regulate aversive emotions. This study’s objective was to clarify whether the enhancement of general adaptive emotion regulation skills reduces subsequent procrastination. For the purpose of this study, data from a two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with (N = 148) university students, comprising an active intervention (IG) and a passive wait-list control (WLC) group, was collected. Participants of the intervention group were provided with an online emotion regulation training over a period of 9 weeks. The results showed that the enhancement of general emotion regulation skills significantly reduced subsequent procrastination behavior within the IG as compared to the untreated WLC. Moreover, subsequent mediation analyses revealed that the reduction of procrastination was significantly mediated by the increase in general ER skills. The present results suggest that trainings which enhance general ER skills are an appropriate measure to reduce procrastination behavior among university students. The practical value of ER training interventions, particularly for student populations, is discussed.

Material and Methods: Adolescents with EA in Norway born between 1996 and 2002 were included. Clinical assessment and patient's characteristics were collected. Quality of life (PedsQL), traumatic stress (IES-13) and mental health (SDQ-20) were compared to groups of healthy controls, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and kidney transplanted children (TX). Results: 68 EA adolescents participated. Total scores for PedsQL were not different from the healthy group and ALL patients, but significantly better than the TX patients. The subscale for physical performance was significantly lower than in healthy adolescents, and nine (17%) patients had scores ≤70 indicating reduced health status. Five EA adolescents (12%) had mental health scores suggesting a psychiatric disorder, and six (9%) reported high traumatic stress scores with a significant correlation to days on ventilator in the neonatal period. The strongest predictors for quality of life among EA adolescents were self-reported mental health, posttraumatic stress and GERD symptoms. Conclusion: Scores for Quality of life in the EA group are good except for subscale for physical performance.

The overwhelming mortality and morbidity mediated by noncommunicable epidemics such as heart disease and cancer have fostered a search for mechanisms to attenuate them. Despite overwhelming success in acute care, the efficacy of modern medicines has been limited on this front. Yoga is one of the integrative therapies that has come to light as having a substantial role in preventing and mitigating such disorders. It thus seems trite to analyze and discuss the research advancements in yoga for 2020. The present review attempts to distill recent research highlights from voluminous literature generated in 2020. Methods: This review was conducted on the articles published or assigned to an issue in 2020. The authors searched the PubMed database for clinical studies published in the English language, using yoga (including meditation) as the intervention, and having an adequate description of the intervention. Then, they extracted data from each study into a standardized Google sheet. Results: A total of 1149 citations were retrieved in the initial search. Of these, 46 studies met eligibility criteria and were finally included. The studies were predominantly on mental health and neuropsychology, addressing various issues such as anxiety, postural balance, migraine, academic performance, and childhood neglect. Anxiety, stress, and depression were other common denominators. Eight studies were on cardiorespiratory systems, including exercise capacity, cardiac rehabilitation, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. Three studies were on diabetes, evaluating the effect of yoga. Five studies focused on cognition, health status, and autonomic regulation and few others included cancers, infertility, ulcerative colitis, urinary incontinence, restless leg syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, and metabolic syndrome. Finally, most studies were on noncommunicable diseases with one exception, human immunodeficiency virus; two randomized controlled trials were dedicated to it. Conclusions: Yoga has been studied under a wide variety of clinicopathological conditions in the year 2020. This landscape review intends to provide an idea of the role of yoga in various clinical conditions and its future therapeutic implications.  © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

In this study, we aim to estimate the prevalence of severe symptoms of mental disorders and examine associated factors among students majoring in foreign languages in Vietnam. We used the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) to detect severe symptoms of mental disorders in 1,788 students, including severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. The Financial-Study-Family-Friend (FSFF) scale was utilized to assess how much students worried about finance, academic, and social support from family and friends. Multiple logistic regressions were carried out to evaluate the relationship between severe symptoms of mental disorders and FSFF factors. The prevalence of severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were 21.1, 35.0, and 16.3%, respectively. While varying somewhat due to students' demographic characteristics, all four aspects of the FSFF scale were related to the severe symptoms of mental disorders of students. Concerns about study had the largest effects (ORs ranging from 2.84 to 3.72) while difficulty in finance had the smallest effects (ORs ranging from 1.23 to 1.37) on students' depression, anxiety, and stress. The prevalence of severe symptoms of mental disorders in students was high in our study. Teachers and universities should focus more attention on students' mental health. Social support from family and friends also plays a crucial role in the mental health of students.

Here, we propose an emotion-aware architecture for persuasive systems in education, identifying challenging classroom situations and promoting mental health through multi-modal persuasive notifications. An important module is emotion inference, which reads real-time physiological data from students through the Empatica E4 wristband. Based on this architecture, we developed the Kusisqa persuasive system, to support students in regulating their negative emotions (They can all lead to stress) during challenging classroom situations.

We put particular emphasis on external and internal differences in students of specific fields–medicine, nursing, psychology, and pedagogy. In a survey, 1,783 students from Medical University of Gdańsk and University of Gdańsk participated in our study, of whom 1,223 were included in the final statistical analysis. All of them were evaluated using valid and reliable questionnaires–TIPI-PL, PSS-10, and a one-item scale of quality of life. Stress turned out to have a negative effect on quality of life, regardless of the type of field of study. Moreover, students from different fields varied in terms of personality factors: conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness to experience, and emotional stability. In conclusion, many students regardless of their field suffer from high stress and report low quality of life, which potentially further affects their academic performance and social life.

To prevent mental health problems and promote mental health, resilience should be promoted in early adolescents. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to develop a resilience program and evaluate the effectiveness of such a programme on the academic problems of Grade 7 students of the Chiang Mai University Demonstration School, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Methods: This quantitative research used a quasi-experimental design, which was a controlled study with a pretest and post-test. The purposive selection was used to choose 70 participants from the Grade 7 students, the academic year 2021 from the Chiang Mai University Demonstration School. The criteria were students who had the lowest resilience inventory score from the student population. The participants were classified with stratified random sampling into the experimental groups (n=35), who received a resilience program through the group’s dynamics once a week for 11 weeks at 60 minutes each time, and the control groups (n=35), who received a resilience knowledge sheet and had a normal life. Two participants in each group withdrew, leaving a total of 33 participants per group. The data were collected by assessing before and after participating in the programme with a general information questionnaire, the Canadian Occupational Performance Measures (COPM), and Resilience Inventory. Descriptive statistical analysis, an independent t-test, and paired t-test were used to analyse the data. Results: This resilience programme had an overall consistency index of 0.78. After treatment, the experimental group and control group had a statistically significant difference in the pretest and post-test resilience scores. (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). The experimental group had pretest and post-test significant differences in academic performance and satisfaction (p < 0.01), while the control group had no statistically significant difference. There was a statistically significant difference in the post-test academic satisfaction between both groups. (p < 0.01), while academic performance displayed no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: This resilience programme, through the groups’ dynamics could contribute to the resilience, academic performance, and academic satisfaction on academic problems. © 2022 Kumkun et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This study measured the stress and anxiety levels of physiotherapy students during clinical placements, how stress/anxiety changed over time, effect on academic performance, factors influencing stress/anxiety and coping strategies. Design: A prospective cohort study using surveys collecting quantitative and qualitative data. Setting: Three sites where physiotherapy students from one university undertook clinical placements. Participants: 109 students across 159 placements. Main outcome measures: The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI [Y2]) provided a baseline measure of general stress level and propensity for anxiety. Perceived stress and anxiety were measured using visual analogue scales (VASs) at baseline and weekly over the 5-weeks duration of placements. A questionnaire sought students’ perceptions of factors affecting stress/anxiety and coping strategies. Results: VAS stress/anxiety scores were highly variable between participants. Higher VAS scores were seen at Weeks 3 and 4 compared to Week 5 and placements earlier in the academic year. Baseline VAS scores were significantly associated with Weeks 1−5 VAS scores. Higher VAS scores were associated with poorer academic results. Stress/anxiety were affected by patient complexity, assessments, workload, poor health and family issues. Most participants felt supported by clinical educators/peers, and used coping strategies including exercise and taking breaks. Conclusions: Physiotherapy students demonstrated highly variable stress/anxiety levels during clinical placements, with higher levels negatively affecting academic performance. Baseline measures of perceived stress/anxiety could potentially highlight students at risk of high levels of stress/anxiety during clinical placements, allowing more targeted interventions.

Data regarding the impact of curricular revision on students' stress level are lacking. The primary objective of this study was to compare perceived stress, academic self-concept, and coping strategies between pharmacy students prior to and following a curricular revision. Secondary objectives included determining university resources used by students to deal with stress. Methods: Students in the first, second, and third years of the pharmacy curriculum were asked to complete a survey, including the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), Brief COPE, and Academic Self-Concept Scale (ASCS), and questions regarding use of university resources. Responses to the PSS-14, Brief COPE, and ASCS were compared to a student cohort prior to the curricular revision. Results: Perceived stress was reduced to a small, statistically significant degree following a curricular revision. In both cohorts, increased stress was statistically significantly correlated with decreased academic self-concept. Students reported increased use of self-distraction, along with decreased use of active coping, substance abuse, and planning, as coping strategies when compared to the previous cohort. Approximately half of the student cohort reported no use of university resources. The most commonly used resources were financial aid and mental health services. Conclusions: Perceived stress decreased following the revision of a Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum. The most common coping strategies were positive and comparable with strategies reported by students in the former curriculum. The impact of curricular changes on student stress and the use of university resources in health professions students warrant further study. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

These disorders decrease worker's productivity, impact industries economically, and cause serious psycho-physical conditions. However, technological advances have leveraged the industry to a novel phase where digitalization and automation provide a new reality. Hence, this industrial transformation may contribute to assists human beings in the workplace with a focus on mental health. This article presents a systematic literature review to investigate studies regarding technologies employed in the care of worker's mental health and the industrial role in this scenario. Three general, three focused, and three descriptive questions highlight the academic progress of industrial concern on mental health, implemented systems and cases, and research challenges. As a result, the review discussed 31 studies, extracted from an initial corpus of 25269, ranging from January 2010 to November 2020. The studies approached stress as the most frequent mental issue in the industry and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the most used machine learning algorithm, where biomarkers presented the primary data extractors to deal with this theme. Moreover, information fusion methods improved the accuracy of specific cases. However, a growing interest in mental health care has emerged only in recent years, and several challenges require efforts before applying systems in real industrial environments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Here, we provide an overview on how the COVID-19 pandemic ampli-fied gender-related vulnerabilities in Brazil, establishing a parallel with the pre-pandemic scenario and evaluating many aspects of the problem, including motherhood and racial issues. At the same time, we also discuss how the abrupt disruption in the labor routine during the COVID-19 pandemic overloaded Brazilian women with household and childcare activities and, more specifically, how women’s ca-reers and scientific-academic production were affected. Briefly, the workload and stress imposed on female researchers force them to choose between their professional accom-plishments and their families, thus exacerbating gender disparities within the Brazilian academia. Studies and gov-ernmental reports reveal that such a burden was even more prominent for mothers with young children and for black scientists. Finally, we describe examples of affirmative ac-tions aimed at counterbalancing gender inequalities within the Brazilian academia, which became crucial to mitigate the effects of the social upheaval during the pandemic. © 2022, Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l.

Good quality sleep is needed for optimal neurocognitive and psychomotor functions as well as physical and mental health. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of poor sleep quality among undergraduate medical students during home confinement at the time of Covid-19 pandemic and analyze the relationship between sleep quality and relevant socio-demographic and psychological variables. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 284 undergraduate medical students of a teaching hospital of Bhubaneswar from October–November 2020. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, relevant information was collected. Sleep quality of the students was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and mental health status of the students using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21). Results: The prevalence of poor sleep quality among undergraduate medical students was 45%. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that students doing exercise for <3 days/week (AOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.01–3.23), spending ≥8 h screen time/day (AOR: 2.02, 95%: 1.12–3.66), having anxiety symptoms (AOR: 3.61, 95% CI: 1.72–7.57), and those who were not satisfied with own self (AOR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.35–5.38) were more likely to report poor sleep quality. Conclusion: Poor sleep quality was prevalent among undergraduate medical students during their home confinement at the time of Covid-19 pandemic.

High academic stress has a negative impact on students learning and overall performance. Objective: To assess perceived academic stress, causes, and coping strategies among undergraduate pharmacy students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Khartoum. Data were collected from randomly selected participants using three validated self-administered questionnaires; perceived stress scale, study habits inventory, and mental health inventory. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, and descriptive statistics and chi-square were employed. Results: The response rate in our study was 99.6% (251/252). About 87% of the participants were females. The majority of participants (92%) experience academic stress, with a mean score (24.99 ± 5.159), the level of academic stress ranging from low (4.3%), moderate (73.2%), to high (22.5%). Approximately 80% of the percipients reported academic stress during all exam times with a mean score (25.33 ± 4.976). The level of academic stress was significantly associated with participants’ gender (P-value: 0.042), and living conditions (P-value: 0.001). The most common factors that were significantly associated with academic stress were difficulty in remembering all that is studied (66.7%, P=0.006) and worrying about the exams (54.1%, P=0.011). Moreover, the most frequent strategies used to cope with academic stress were praying (84.4%) and maintaining some control over the situation (61.9%).

The current study seems to be the first to consider the joint and partial mediation effects of MS and PE in linking AC to graduates’ job performance in specific areas such as teamwork (TW), communication competence (CC), customer service (CS), and job functions (JF). A virtual cross-section of 3,862 graduates with self-reported cases of having taken alcohol in the past participated in the study. These participants responded to an electronic questionnaire that was mailed to them. The instrument used for data collection had acceptable psychometric properties. The study used the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to achieve its objectives. The inner and outer models were all evaluated for quality and goodness of fit. Results showed a significant negative effect of AC and MS on graduates’ job performance in terms of TW, CC, CS, and JF, respectively. AC had a significant positive effect on MS and PE. MS had a significant positive effect on PE. A significant joint mediation effect of MS and PE was found in linking AC to graduates’ TW, CC, and CS, excluding JF. MS partially mediated AC’s paths to all the graduates’ job performance indicators. PE was only a significant partial mediator of the connection between AC to JF, but not TW, CC, and CS. This study’s result can help improve graduates’ work effectiveness and has revealed some negative predictors. Therefore, it is recommended that graduates avoid alcohol or only consume mild quantities of it to enable them to discharge services effectively at the workplace. © Common Ground Research Networks, Valentine Joseph Owan, Jennifer Uzoamaka Duruamaku-Dim, Abigail Edem Okon, Levi Udochukwu Akah, Daniel Clement Agurokpon, All Rights Reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Design/methodology/approach: The researchers used a five-construct questionnaire, namely, use of digital tools in e-learning, sleeping habits, social interaction, psychological reactions and academic performance, to elicit the responses of university students in Jordan concerning the psychological impact of COVID-19’s e-learning digital tools on their well-being. In total, 775 university-level students representing Jordanian public and private universities were asked to fill in the questionnaire, and their responses were statistically analyzed. Findings: The results showed that the prolonged use of digital tools, lack of face-to-face interaction and heavy load of assignments have led to anxiety, change of sleeping habit, distraction and a stress-building environment, perhaps resulting in depression. This was aggravated by COVID-19’s strict regulatory measures of social distancing, lockdowns, health threats and eroding family income. The prolonged and escalating social, psychological, loss of affection and worsening economic conditions have increased the number of psychological disorders and a drop in students’ academic performance. Practical implications: This study is useful for educational leaders and policymakers, providing guidance and insights on how higher education institutions can support students’ mental health and psychological well-being, especially in times of crisis. Consequently, the higher education sector should be prepared to function more efficiently and effectively in future emergency situations. Originality/value: While different studies have investigated the impact of COVID-19 on the education sector globally, little attention has been given to developing countries in the Middle East.

Aim: To examine pharmacy undergraduate students’ perceptions of the impact of mental illnesses on pharmacy education in Nigeria. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among pharmacy students from six Nigerian universities. The data were collected using a modified self-administered paper-based Mental Illness Performance Scale. Descriptive statistics, Student t-test, and One-way analysis of variance were used for the data analysis. Results: The study received responses from 496 pharmacy students, yielding a 93.2% response rate. A vast majority of the students agreed or strongly agreed that depression (98.7%), anxiety (98.4%), and substance abuse (83.9%) affect pharmacy students' academic performance. Fewer students agreed or strongly agreed that depression (31.4%) and anxiety disorder (37.9%) would be grounds for expulsion from pharmacy school. Substance abuse (62.5%) and schizophrenia (58.1%) were supported as reasons for rejecting an applicant into the pharmacy programme. Conclusion: The findings suggest that pharmacy students perceive that having a mental disorder would negatively affect pharmacy education in Nigeria. © 2022 FIP.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Unmitigated stress impacts both physical and mental health while increasing the risk of unethical behavior. It is important for medical institutions to identify strategies that effectively reduce perceived stress and improve the well-being of their students. Methods: The authors undertook a scoping review of the literature to identify strategies implemented by medical educational programs to improve the well-being of medical students. Results: Of 1068 articles identified, 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions were categorized as mindfulness-based programs, reflection groups, curriculum changes, and ‘miscellaneous.’ All studies assessed outcomes of student stress/resilience, as well as additional domains including academic performance, mental health, and interpersonal skills. Some also assessed the acceptability of the intervention to students. Conclusions: Despite the heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures, a clear theme emerged that institutionally-provided strategies to promote student well-being tend to be effective when students opt into the program. It was noted that adding mandatory content or activities to a medical program without creating adequate space or support for it can have the opposite effect. Further high quality intervention studies involving randomization, blinding and rigorous controls are warranted. © 2022 The Author(s).

Universities are positioned to take proactive measures by creating environments that support student learning and minimise anxiety, such as incorporating mindfulness concepts. Previous research on mindfulness practice shows potential to benefit healthy people in the general population, yet few studies consider the environment in structured student experiences of learning mindfulness in higher education. In this qualitative research study, we explored the learning experiences of 58 students enrolled in a university mindfulness and well-being course, as to what factors they felt contributed most to their learning experience. Using thematic data analysis (Clarke & Braun, 2016) from weekly student responses to 3–5 qualitative questions, we generated themes from students’ course experiences that determined the establishment of a conducive learning environment. These experiential themes fit together as an archetype, a model we titled ‘Mindful University-Student Learning Community’ containing three sequential categories: 1) creating a safe learning environment; 2) transitional state; and 3) a community of mindful individuals. Our findings indicate that universities can implement mindful teaching practices that help to foster a conducive learning environment, supporting students’ psychological well-being and successful engagement with academic materials. © 2022 UCU.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This cross-sectional study utilized the 15th (2019) Korea Youth Risk Bsehavior Web-based Survey. Of the 57,303 survey participants, 749 reported that their father, mother, or both parents were born outside of Korea. These 749 multicultural individuals were selected as study participants. We examined general characteristics (sex, grade, parental education level, academic performance level, foreign nationality, residence type, economic status, exposure to violence, and frequency of physical activity), health risk behaviors (sexual activity, drug use, and drinking), and mental health factors (sleep, depression, and presence of suicidal thoughts) to determine whether these factors may contribute to multicultural adolescent stress. Multicultural adolescents who reported insufficient sleep, depression, or suicidal thoughts were more likely to experience stress than those who did not report these factors. Moreover, participants with insufficient sleep were 3.73 times more likely to feel stress than those with good sleep. Among general characteristics, health risk behaviors, and mental health factors, mental health factors were observed to significantly predict an increase in multicultural adolescents’ stress levels. Considering the increase in the number of multicultural adolescents in Korea, it is important to address the difficulties they experience to provide appropriate interventional programs. Such programs should include techniques to help with the management of stress. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The current situation shows that Malaysian university students are also affected by this problem. Several factors made students more prone to mental health problems, such as their quality of life. However, such factors are difficult to detect from the beginning. This could affect the students' productivity which will bring consequences to the community's future if ignored. This paper aims to identify factors that lead to mental health issues among university students by analyzing the relationship between the DASS-21 score and the facets score in the WHOQOL. The data collection involves six hundred thirty-five students. The data were analyzed and cleaned. The data with the DASS-21 score equal to mild and above were selected for the analysis. Two clustering algorithms; Two-step and K-means, were applied and compared. Silhouette scores which measure the cluster quality, were used to compare the performance of both algorithms. For both algorithms, the best number of clusters generated were two with cluster quality equal to 0.4. After that, we analyzed both clusters generated to identify factors contributing to the mental health problem. Based on the analysis, we found that the students who scored severe and extremely severe in DASS-21 rated lowest in four facets: study, self-esteem, memory, and positive feeling. These factors should be highlighted by university management, counselling unit, and academician to prevent this issue among university students. Future work will produce prediction rules for the mental health status prediction task among university students using the outcome from the clustering task.  © 2022 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

During the COVID-19 pandemic, male and female students have reported specific stressors that have impacted their well-being and mental health, including difficulty concentrating, concerns about academic performance, and classroom workload. All of these stressors could be mitigated by instructional quality in courses. This study sought to better understand the associations between instructional quality and mental health impairment, i.e., poor mental health and high psychological distress, among male and female undergraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We asked whether perceived instructional quality has a protective effect on students’ mental health with regard to academic stress and academic satisfaction across genders. We used longitudinal data from an ethnically diverse sample of 209 students (68% females, 82% freshmen, 50% Asian, 32% Hispanic, 13% White, 5% other) from a public university in Southern California, United States. Data were assessed during the winter and spring quarters of the academic year 2019–2020, i.e., before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Associations between instructional quality and students’ mental health impairment did not differ across genders. The findings indicated that perceived instructional quality at the beginning of the spring quarter 2020 was indirectly related to male and female students’ mental health impairment at the end of this quarter. This association was mediated by academic satisfaction. This finding points to a protective effect of instructional quality on students’ mental health. However, no effect was found concerning changes to mental health. Gender differences occurred in the link between academic stress and mental health impairment. Academic stress was a stronger predictor of mental health impairment for female students compared to male students. Furthermore, for female students alone, academic stress predicted changes in mental health impairment. We discuss practical implications for higher education. First, our study highlighted that instructional quality in higher education courses might lead to academic satisfaction and thereby help protect university students’ mental health. Second, higher education might consider providing additional support for (female) students to improve their stress management. We argue that improving and enhancing the academic environment are more important than reducing the burden of stressors.

Methods: This cross-sectional study used the Spring 2019 National College Health Assessment-II data collected across 58 Canadian post-secondary institutions from 55,284 respondents. Of this, 31,091 undergraduate students indicated being stressed in the past year and were included in this analysis. Ten variables were selected based on their relevance to human and psychological capital in the literature, and an additional seven socio-demographic variables were adjusted for in subsequent analyses. The associations between these explanatory variables and stress impacting students’ academic performances were examined by fitting mixed univariable and mixed multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Students who had a high cumulative grade point average, received information on stress reduction, were aware of mental health resources on campus, felt experiences that challenged them to grow and become a better person, felt their life had a sense of direction or meaning to it, felt interested in life, felt confident, and felt they had something important to contribute to society reported significantly lower odds of experiencing stress that negatively impacted their academic performance. Students who previously utilized psychological or mental health services and who felt hopeless reported significantly higher odds of experiencing stress affecting their academic performance. Conclusion: Targeting these components within post-secondary institutions may cultivate human and psychological capital, mitigate the deleterious effects of stress affecting academic success, and promote intrapersonal resiliency skill-building among students. © 2022 Society for Research into Higher Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Despite widespread efforts to reduce student burnout through wellness programming in medical schools, there is a paucity of literature examining students’ perception of wellness and engagement with these programs. As such, we sought to evaluate: 1) medical students’ level of engagement with a multifaceted wellness curriculum, 2) factors students perceived as important to wellbeing, and 3) associations with longitudinal measures of wellbeing and perceived stress. Intervention: A multipronged wellness curriculum was instituted at Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine-AZ (MCASOM-AZ) in 2017. This includes mental health services, curriculum-embedded seminars, wellness committee (composed of students, faculty, and administration) driven programming, and student proposed wellness activities that are reviewed and funded by the committee. The authors invited students at our institution to complete questionnaires at three timepoints during the 2018–2019 academic year. Questionnaires asked participants to rank eight factors from least to most important to their overall wellbeing. Participants self-reported their participation in each prong of the wellness curriculum and ranked the impact of each on their overall wellbeing. Their wellbeing and perceived stress were measured at each timepoint using validated psychological instruments. Context: As MCASOM-AZ opened in 2017, the student body at the time of study consisted of first- and second-year medical students. All students had the opportunity to engage with all aspects of the wellness curriculum and participate in this study, however participation was elective and all responses were anonymous. Of the MCASOM-AZ student body comprised of 100 students, 58 consented to participate in the study, 41.4% of which were Year 1 and 58.6% of which were Year 2 students. Participant age and gender were collected and were representative of the larger student body. Impact: Students engaged most with student-initiated wellness. They perceived unscheduled time as most impactful to their overall wellbeing with student-initiated activities as second-most impactful. Students with higher perceived stress were more likely than others to use mental health resources, which otherwise ranked lower in importance. Ranking academic performance as important to wellbeing was associated with higher wellbeing. There was no difference in wellbeing between students who participated in the wellness curriculum and those who did not. However, overall student wellbeing increased over the course of the year while perceived stress decreased. Lessons Learned: Medical school programs may benefit from allowing students to direct or contribute to the design of their own wellness curriculum. Additionally, medical education should work toward creating a more supportive learning environment with improved flexibility in order to better meet students’ individual needs without compromising their education. Despite having low utilization rates overall, mental health resources remain an important aspect of student support services as they are used by students under greater amounts of perceived stress than their peers.

Participants: A total of 370 students in Qatar who consented to participate between February 2017 and February 2018. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed perceived stress [using a validated 4-point perceived stress scale (PSS-4)], as well as diet, exercise, body mass index, sleep, and life satisfaction. Results: Among students aged 18–39 (mean = 20.1 ± 3.0 years), PSS-4 scores varied between 0 and 16 (mean = 7.4 ± 3.4). Elevated stress was significantly associated with female sex, country of origin, residing off-campus, eating when bored, lack of self-discipline, disturbed sleep, and low levels of life satisfaction. Furthermore, students with PSS-4 scores above the median level were 2.3 times likelier to report difficulty concentrating on academic work. Conclusion: Elevated stress levels are present in university students in Qatar. Strengthening coping skills may improve health and academic performance. © 2021 The Author(s).

Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal behavior, and effects of the components of coping strategies on suicidal behavior among medical students Methodology An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students of a college located in North India for a period of 2 months from February to March 2021. A total of 531 study participants (calculated sample size) were selected, and then allocated proportionally to each academic year, both through stratified random sampling technique. Then, the participants were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic characteristics, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), and coping inventory. A pretest was done to modify the coping inventory and then exploratory factor analysis was performed on it to classify the components of coping strategies. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to determine the risk factors and their association with suicidal behavior. Results A total of 104 (19.6%) respondents had reported SBQ-R cutoff score > 7 and had suicidal behavior. The rate of lifetime suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt was 20.3, 10.3, and 2.3%, respectively, among medical students, with 1-year prevalence of suicidal ideation at 33%. The mean age of the participants was 21.26 years (standard deviation = 1.99). The identified risk factors significantly associated with higher suicidal behavior were depression (odds ratio [OR] = 9.6), dissatisfaction with academic performances (OR = 4.9), and coping with mental disengagement (OR = 4.6), while coping with supportive strategies (OR = 0.57) was investigated as a preventive factor for the suicidal behavior. Conclusion The prevalence of suicidal behavior is found to be highly alarming, revealing that depression and poor coping strategies are risk factors among medical students. The analysis recommends that quantification of the problems, treatment at an early stage, and proactive student counseling to help them embrace the appropriate coping strategies, should be the first steps in prevention of suicidal behavior. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Conducted in 2010-2011, the study included 95% of all eligible children aged 7-9 years living in the very remote Aboriginal communities of the Fitzroy Valley, Western Australia. Women from Marninwarntikura Women's Resource Centre, a local Aboriginal-led organisation, are concerned that some participants from the study are struggling in adolescence so partnered with researchers from the University of Sydney to follow up the Lililwan cohort in 2020-2022 at age 17-19 years. The overarching aim of the Bigiswun Kid Project is to identify adolescents' needs and build knowledge to inform services to improve the health and well-being of adolescents in remote Aboriginal communities. The specific aims are to: (1) provide a voice to adolescents and their families to understand the health and well-being status of the Lililwan cohort at 17-19 years. (2) Examine relationships between exposures during pregnancy, birth characteristics, and health and neurodevelopment at 7-9 years, and positive/adverse adolescent outcomes at 17-19 years. This information will identify prenatal and early life factors that predict good health and well-being in adolescence. (3) Determine whether management plans provided in the Lililwan Project were followed, and identify past and present service gaps, support needs and barriers to service use. (4) Determine if key physical characteristics of FASD change between childhood and adolescence in this Aboriginal population.

We estimated the prevalence of psychological morbidity and its associated factors, among school-going adolescents in higher secondary schools of urban Puducherry. Methods We did this cross-sectional study among adolescents studying in classes 11 and 12 from selected schools of urban Puducherry, including one government and three private schools. Study tools used were the General Health Questionnaire-12 and Perceived Stress Scale-10 to assess psychological morbidity and perceived psychological stress in adolescents, respectively. Risk factors in academic, environmental, personal and health-related domains were captured using a structured questionnaire. Study questionnaires were self-administered by the participants in classrooms. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done to identify risk factors for psychological morbidity. Results Of the 820 adolescents surveyed, the prevalence of psychological morbidity was 25.4% (95% CI 22.4- 28.5). Academic factors such as reporting peer pressure for academic performance and lack of extracurricular activities at school were associated with psychological morbidity. Among health-related factors, adolescents who reported having difficulty in coping with pubertal changes, being worried about their physical appearance, reporting substance abuse and experiencing sleep disturbances had greater chances of having screened with psychological morbidity. Of note, adolescents with psychological stress had 2.5 times higher chances of having psychological morbidity. Conclusions We estimated that 1 in 4 school-going adolescents in urban Puducherry suffered psychological morbidity. Reducing the academic burden and advocating health promotion through a life skills approach may improve mental wellness in Indian adolescents.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

And studies have shown that a wide range of physiological, functional, nerve, and organ damage will have a great impact on the mental health of children. At present, there is no relevant psychological intervention research for cSLE in China. This paper aimed to explore the effect of Sandplay therapy on mental health and disease activity of children with cSLE. Methods: Forty childrens with cSLE were randomly divided into control group (CG) and intervention group (IG); the CG were treated with glucocorticoid, immunosuppressant and other drugs, while the IG were treated with Sandplay therapy in addition to drug therapy, at the time of 0, 2, and 4 weeks after initial diagnosis, respectively. The questionnaire evaluation and related clinical indicators of the two groups were compared and analyzed (before psychotherapy intervention) at 0, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after initial diagnosis. Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the evaluation of questionnaire and related clinical indicators at the time 0, 2 weeks after initial diagnosis respectively. At 12 weeks after the intervention, the score of Short version of the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI-S) in the IG was significantly lower than that in the CG, the score of The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) scale in the IG was significantly lower than that in the CG, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0) showed that the scores of social function, school performance, and emotional health of the IG were higher than those of the CG (p < 0.05), and the clinical indexes of the IG were better than those of the CG (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Sandplay therapy may help to slow down the occurrence and development of anxiety and depression and reduce disease activity in patients with cSLE. © The Author(s) 2022.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study intends to identify the level of anxiety, depression, and stress among university students and determine its association with their sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: The primary data were collected from 351 students with the help of a self-administrated questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic information and contains the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) instrument over the period December 8, 2019–January 23, 2020. The χ2 test is employed to find the association between the status of stress, anxiety, and depression level with selected sociodemographic variables, and confirmatory factor analysis is used to find interrelationships between DASS items. Results: The results illustrate that no students have an extremely severe level of stress. However, the majority have a mild or moderate level of stress and it is associated with sex and residence (urban or rural). More than 40% of students have extremely severe anxiety. Results reveal that gender, residence (urban or rural), and family type of the students are linked with the anxiety level. The results also suggest that the type of accommodation of the students, their family type, and birth order are related to their depression level at a 5% level of significance. The findings also disclose that female students have more levels of depression, stress, and anxiety than their counterparts. Conclusion: Considering the finding, the authors think that the university authority should pay a need for greater interest to the mental well-being of students to enhance their quality of life. Given the harmful impacts of stress on academic performance and health, university administrators should be incorporating anxiety, stress, and depression management training in orientation activities. © 2022 The Authors.

We aimed to study the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 on intestinal permeability and stress-markers during public speech. Healthy students were randomized to L. rhamnosus-containing (test) or acidified (placebo) milk consumed twice daily for 4 weeks, with 46 subjects per treatment group. Small intestinal permeability was quantified by a 2 h urinary lactulose–mannitol ratio (LMR, primary outcome), fractional excretion of lactulose (FEL) and mannitol (FEM). Salivary cortisol, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Perceived Stress scores (PSS) were collected. No between-treatment differences were found for LMR (p = .71), FEL or FEM. Within-treatment analyses showed similar LMR and FEL but a stress-induced increase of FEM with the placebo (p < .05) but not test product. Despite a similar increase in salivary cortisol, the stress-induced increase in STAI was significantly lower with the test product vs. placebo (p = .01). Moreover, a stress-preventative effect of the probiotic was found for PSS and more pronounced in subjects with high stress-induced cortisol (p = .01). While increased FEM was mediated by salivary cortisol levels, the effect of the test product on subjective stress was not mediated by changes in FEM. No serious adverse events occurred. In conclusion, we demonstrated that L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 prevented stress-induced hyperpermeability to mannitol. Subjective but not objective stress-markers were reduced with L. rhamnosus vs. placebo, suggesting anxiolytic effects, which were independent of barrier stabilization and attractive for the reduction of stress in both health and disease.

International students are prone to acculturation stress as a consequence of cultural differences. Many research reports show that social support is a great buffer against experienced stress, but there has thus far been no study that analyzes the real effect of social support on acculturation stress. This meta-analysis study aims to investigate the true effect of social support on acculturation stress of international students based on studies reporting it. A meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA. The electronic databases used were Science-Direct, ERIC, ProQuest, Google Scholar (only for ETD), and opengrey.edu, with the article year limitations being 2009–2019. Eight (8) studies were involved in the meta-analysis. There were three instruments of acculturation stress and five instruments of social support that were used in the different studies. The effect size analysis showed that there was no difference in the effects of eight studies (z = −0.553; SE = 0.497; 95% CI = −1.248–−0.699; p = 0.580). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant moderator variable, the instruments used were quite diverse. The role of a moderator, other than gender, was not used because of limited information from the studies used. Social support plays a major role in reducing acculturation stress in international students. However, studies involving moderator and confounding roles need to be conducted. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, we aimed to identity key sleep health characteristics, including markers for obstructive sleep apnea, as well as its relation to mental health, physical health, and academic performance. Methods: A cross-sectional study design with online survey dissemination was used. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were conducted among a predominantly minority population. Results: Results show that nearly 78% of the population reported that the pandemic impacted their mental or physical health, while over 83% reported daytime tiredness/fatigue/sleepiness, and another 61% reported sleeping less than seven hours during weekdays. Among other associa-tions, pandemic-related poor sleep health, including sleeping less than seven hours, was associated with daytime tiredness/fatigue/sleepiness, psychological distress, as well as low mental health and physical health. A severe marker for obstructive sleep apnea, having stopped breathing during sleep, was also associated with psychological distress during the pandemic. Conclusions: Sleep health interventions are critical for optimizing college student health and well-being, including improving mental health outcomes. © 2022 by the authors.

The preparation period before the exam places students at high risk for burnout and depression, leading to impaired exam performance and other serious consequences including suicide. Many medical schools already provide academic support for students during USMLE Step 1 preparation, yet to date, there are no published programs specifically geared towards mental health support during this time. Methods: Students from the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont developed the “Step-Siblings” program to partner pre-clinical level students preparing for Step 1 (Little Sibs) with clinical-level students (Big Sibs) in an effort to promote near-peer mentorship and support for those studying. Big Sibs were trained to offer emotional support and wellness advice, but specifically not to provide academic counselling. The pilot program was evaluated by student surveys. Results: Our program successfully paired Little Sibs (n = 125) with Big Sibs (n = 75) several months preceding the Step 1 dedicated study period, achieving the intended effect of reducing burnout and fostering a supportive community during a notoriously isolating and emotionally challenging time. Survey results indicated that a majority of Little and Big Sibs found the program helpful. Conclusions: This student-driven mentorship model is simple to implement, easily generalizable to other medical schools and other board exams, and bears the lasting benefit of combatting the stress and burnout so prevalent in medical education. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Association of Medical Science Educators.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: Twelve parents of children with concussion completed a semi-structured interview with the lead author. Questions broadly focused on post-concussion stress, with specific probes for caregiving responsibilities, concussion knowledge, and athletic participation. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Ten mothers and 2 fathers participated. Five themes stemmed from our analysis: 1) Concussion Knowledge (central theme): stressors related to sources of concussion information; 2) Child Health Factors: stressors related to injury and illness, including concussion; 3) Activity Factors: stressors related to academic and athletic performance; 4) Parent-Injured Child Relationship Factors: stressors related to providing care to the child; and 5) Personal Factors: stressors unrelated to the concussion (e.g. family, social, career, etc.). Child Health Factors was most frequently identified as the primary stressor (n = 9). Conclusions: Sources of parental stress were varied following pediatric concussion. Issues relating to the child’s post-injury dysfunction and the uncertain recovery from concussion were key stressors identified by parents. Moving forward, this framework can be used to ground the development of specific parental stress screening tools and interventions, which may benefit the parent’s mental health and the child’s clinical recovery. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The research data were obtained in 2015-2021 in Chelyabinsk. The study involved female students of the Institute of Sport, Tourism and Service of South Ural State University (mean age 20.95±0.26 years). The sample consisted only of female students engaged in different sports and PE training activities 2 hours per week. Female students were divided into two subgroups with high and low levels of sleep with respect to certain mental health parameters. The first subgroup involved female students with high levels of sleep (n=147), the second-with low levels (n=72). Diagnostics of the quality of sleep and mental health components was carried out using a 10-point self-assessment scale. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of sports skills, sports experience, age, body length and body weight. Some mental health parameters affect the level of sleep among female students. The following parameters of mental health have a positive effect on the quality of sleep: mood stability, energy level, mental performance, communicative skills, assertiveness and the desire to engage in academic, sports, and other activities. Mental health parameters that have a negative impact on the level of sleep include increased excitement, emotional excitability, stressogenic factors, psychological stress. The data obtained should be considered as a pattern, which indicates the direction of psychological and pedagogical influences aimed at improving students’ sleep quality and mental health. © JPES.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, commonly consumed fermented and prebiotic-containing foods have not been well-tested. The aim of the present study was to determine whether consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics is associated with cognitive performance, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in psychiatrically healthy medical students under psychological stress. Methods: The study protocol with data analysis plan was prospectively registered. Food consumption was evaluated with a 7-day dietary record. Cognitive performance was modeled with academic examination performance in relation to subject knowledge. Pre-exam depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively. Results: In total, 372 medical students (22.7 ± 1.1 years of age, 66% female) completed the study. No relationship was observed between cognitive performance under stress and either fermented food (adjusted β 0.02, 95% CI −0.07–0.11, p = 0.63) or food-derived prebiotics consumption (adjusted β −0.00, 95% CI −0.09–0.09, p = 0.99). High intake of fermented food was associated with more severe depressive (adjusted β 0.11, 95% CI 0.01–0.20, p = 0.032) and anxiety symptoms under stress (adjusted β 0.13, 95% CI 0.04–0.22, p = 0.0065); however, no such link was observed for food-derived prebiotics (adjusted β 0.03, 95% CI −0.07–0.13, p = 0.50 and −0.01, 95% CI −0.11–0.08, p = 0.83, for depression and anxiety, respectively). Conclusions: Under psychological stress in medical students, consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics appears to be not associated with cognitive performance. High intake of fermented food, but not food-derived prebiotics, may be associated with severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The safety of fermented food in this regard therefore requires further clarification.

There is a high level of demand, especially in areas such as engineering, which can affect the mental health of students, producing high levels of stress and psychological distress, hindering self-efficacy and academic performance. Embodied learning working on self-awareness, stress reduction and self-knowledge can help to generate healthier environments. Creative therapies can be a tool to promote the prevention of health problems in this group of the population. In particular, Dance Movement Therapy has demonstrated its effectiveness in improving health in clinical and non-clinical settings. In this work, a body awareness program based on Dance Movement Therapy is developed and implemented in engineering students. Through a mixed pre-post methodology, its impact is evaluated and analyzed in an experimental group of engineering students. Psychometric tests, physiological variables and reflective diaries are used as data sources. The results show that the experimental group, compared with the control group, increased their levels of body awareness and connectedness, well-being and life satisfaction and reduced their stress levels. The results were supported by cortisol measures. Likewise, the students acknowledged having increased their levels of self-awareness and self-knowledge and considered the inclusion of these bodily approaches in higher education to be necessary. © 2022 by the authors.

The current study applied the job demands–resources model and analyzed whether family supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB) moderated associations between work stress and feelings of exhaustion as a job resource and whether feelings of exhaustion ultimately mediated the link between work stress and academic employees’ publication activity. The current online cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted in 133 academic employees (65.4% women, 34.6% men; Mage = 41.9, SD = 10.1) at an Austrian medical university and assessed employees’ numbers of publications, H-index, work stress, feelings of exhaustion, FSSB, and work–family services used. Manifest path models revealed that FSSB moderated the link between experiencing high levels of work stress and strong feelings of exhaustion, especially in employees who had at least one child below the age of 18. Part-time employment was most strongly linked with lower numbers of publications and lower H-index levels. The finding that FSSB acted as a job resource mostly for employees with at least one child below 18 underlines the fact that FSSB is different from other forms of supervisor support. The current study supports recommendations to increase the amount of work–family services and to change organizational norms to be supportive of the successful management of family and work obligations. © 2022 by the authors.

Patient-related outcome measures and experiences provide a unique opportunity to understand the impact rare chronic disorders have on a patient's life as well as allowing healthcare providers to compare and improve performance. Aim: To understand the physical and psychosocial impact that RPF has upon peoples' lives. Design: An international online questionnaire was therefore created to gain insights into how patients with RPF, a rare fibro-inflammatory condition, viewed their health and experiences. Methods: An international online questionnaire comprising 62 questions/free text options, was designed in collaboration with two patient advocates and the multi-disciplinary Renal Association Rare Disease Registry (RaDaR) RPF Group the questionnaire was anonymous and freely accessible on a GOOGLE Form online platform for 6 months. Results: A total of 229 patients from 30 countries across 5 continents responded. Four key issues were identified; (i) pain; (ii) therapy-related side effects; (iii) lack of informed doctors/information about their condition and its management; and (iv) psychological burden. Variations in diagnosis and management are highlighted with 55% undergoing a biopsy to reach a diagnosis of RPF; 75% of patients underwent a further interventional procedure with 60% concurrently treated medically. Conclusion: This study will guide further development of clinical and academic multi-disciplinary activity and shows the importance of trying to understand the impact of rare chronic disorders on the physical and psychological aspects of a patient's health.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This fact could have had a negative impact on academic stress levels of students and the classroom climate, especially in the university context. The main aim of the present study was to identify changes in academic stress and the perceived classroom climate caused by COVID-19 in a sample of Spanish university students. Academic stress was evaluated trough the Stressor Academic Scale (SAS) and perceived classroom climate employing the Perceived Classroom Responsibility Climate (PCRC) questionnaire. A longitudinal study was conducted. 135 students (97 females and 38 males) from the Gastronomy (n = 31) and Criminology (n = 104) degrees were evaluated before and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. Academic stress levels and perceived classroom climate were analyzed before (Time 1) and after (Time 2) the lockdown declaration. An increase in academic stress was found, especially in the categories regarding Teachers’ Methodological Defi-ciencies, Academic Over-Burden and Beliefs About Performances. Females and final year students suffered higher levels of academic stress. No differences were found between Time 1 and 2 in perceived classroom climate. The obtained results point out a significant increase of academic stress in university students due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. The implemented educational changes and the uncertainty that resulted from the pandemic could have a significant negative impact on mental health in this population, resulting in higher levels of academic stress, especially in females and final year students. Future studies should analyze the strategies that students are employing to cope with these educational challenges and intervention strategies to promote them in the context of higher education. © 2022 by the authors.

In addition to typical developmental tasks, Korean adolescents experience unique stressors due to highly competitive nature of the educational system in the country. It is commonly believed that they are more likely to get high-paying jobs or higher social status once they enter prestigious universities. This belief forces the students to spend a considerable amount of time studying and results in pressure to show high levels of academic performance. Consequently, Korean adolescents experience excessive academic stress, which may lead to a broad range of psychological difficulties. These stressors have led to an increased number of clients seeking counselling services in the past years, with a total of 5 million students at all school levels presenting in 2018. The presenting issues and concerns included interpersonal relationships, academic/career difficulties, mental health issues and juvenile delinquency. In order to best serve adolescent clients, Korea has different service delivery systems including Community Youth Safety-Net (CYS-Net). This system provides at-risk adolescents with customised services including counselling, protection, education and shelters by linking youth-related resources in the community. Overall, the current article provides information regarding the Korean counselling system for adolescents. Specifically, we present (a) characteristics of the counselling system, (b) prevalence of presenting issues in counselling, (c) client characteristics, (d) service delivery systems, and (e) employment status of adolescent counsellors and school counsellors.

Signs of maladaptive coping behaviors in nursing students are identifiable and can be opportunities to provide additional resources facilitating success. The problem of nursing student persistence is perennial, and the strategies to improve nursing student persistence remain unclear. Purpose: This integrative review seeks to describe, map measurement tools, and synthesize current literature on the impacts of maladaptive coping behaviors in the pre-licensure nursing student population. Method: This study used Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review methodology (2005). Six databases were searched for reports of pre-licensure nursing students' maladaptive coping behaviors. Themes of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances related to nursing students' maladaptive coping behaviors emerged from 24 articles. In addition to the categories, the review table captures strategies for measuring student maladaptive coping behaviors. Results: The literature reported high levels of maladaptive coping behaviors in pre-licensure nursing students. Specific maladaptive coping behaviors included depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. While the causes of these high rates of maladaptive coping behaviors were inconclusive, the maladaptive coping behaviors could negatively affect academic, mental health, and distress performance. Conclusion: Pre-licensure nursing students have high levels of maladaptive coping behaviors. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were among the maladaptive coping behaviors. The high rates of maladaptive coping behaviors affect student mental health, performance, and success. © 2022 The Authors","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: This study developed a model to predict suicidal ideation by using logistic regression analysis. The model aimed to understand the relationship between predictors associated with the suicidal ideation of South Korean adolescents by using the top seven variables with the highest feature importance confirmed in XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting). The regression model was developed using a nomogram so that medical workers could easily interpret the probability of suicidal ideation and identify groups vulnerable to suicidal ideation. Results: This epidemiological study predicted that eighth graders who experienced depression in the past 12 months, had a lot of subjective stress, frequently felt lonely in the last 12 months, experienced much-worsened household economic status during the COVID-19 pandemic, and had poor academic performance were vulnerable to suicidal ideation. The results of 10-fold cross-validation revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the adolescent suicidal ideation prediction nomogram was 0.86, general accuracy was 0.89, precision was 0.87, recall was 0.89, and the F1-score was 0.88. Conclusion: It is required to recognize the seriousness of adolescent suicide and mental health after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare a customized support system that considers the characteristics of persons at risk of suicide at the school or community level.

Despite its benefits, it is suggested that dependence on social media diminishes moti-vation to participate in naturally occurring activities and life interests leading to mental health risks. The aim of this study was to assess the potential association between excessive Facebook use and emotional discomfort (depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) in a student population in Palestine. A descriptive cross-sectional design was utilized in this investigation. The study population included all students at a major university in Palestine. The sample included 1003 students of mixed gender and area of study. A survey of Facebook utilization, perceived academic success and mental health risk was completed by each participant. Almost all participants [938 (98.3%)] were Facebook users with a high utilization population identified [239 (26%) spending over 3 hours daily on Face-book]and262 (28.3%) had over 300 Facebook friends. A relationship between the intensity of Face-book use/ number of Facebook friends and symptoms of anxiety and depression was found; higher levels of use predicting higher levels of symptoms (p <0.05). Furthermore, a significant association between scores on the Facebook Intensity Scale (FIS)and perceived negative effect on educational performance was demonstrated(p<0.001). The excessive use of Facebook in environments of social and leisure restriction may lead to increased risk for mental health symptomology and interfere with actual developmental tasks by negatively impacting academic achievement and other indicators of success for young adults. © 2022, An-Najah National University.

In Zambia, little is known about the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare students. This study assessed the psychological impact of COVID-19 on health professions students at the University of Zambia. Methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2021 to October 2021. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with anxiety and depression among the participants. Data were analysed using Stata 16.1. Results: of the 452 students, 57.5% were female, with the majority aged between 19 and 24 years. Overall, 65% (95% CI: 60.5-69.4) experienced anxiety, while 86% (95% CI: 82.7-89.3) experienced depression. Participants whose income was affected were more likely to experience anxiety (aOR; 2.09, 95% CI: 1.29-3.37) and depression (aOR; 2.87, 95% CI: 1.53-5.38). Anxiety was associated with difficulty in observing the COVID-19 preventive measures (aOR; 1.84, 95% CI: 1.21-2.81). Being depressed was associated with having a chronic condition (aOR; 3.98, 95% CI: 1.67-9.50) or a relative or friend who died from COVID-19 (aOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.06-3.70). Conclusion: many students experienced anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 third wave of infections. This calls for mitigation measures because continued anxiety and depression can affect the academic performance of students. Fortunately, most of the associated factors are modifiable and can easily be targeted when formulating interventions to reduce anxiety and depression among students. © Steward Mudenda et al.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, there are limited studies about smartphone addiction and its impacts on university students in Saudi Arabia. This qualitative study aimed to elicit students’ and university staff’s perspectives and experiences about smartphone overuse/addiction in Umm Al-Qura University (UQU), Saudi Arabia. Fifteen undergraduate students and 18 university staff (13 lecturers and five professionals) were recruited for the purpose of this study. The study data were collected using semi-structured interviews and ana-lysed using thematic analysis. The qualitative data comprising 33 participants (students and staff) identified four major themes including the perception of smartphone use; causes of smartphone overuse; negative impacts of smartphone overuse; and strategies to reduce the overuse of smartphone. The overall findings confirmed that students and staff alike held both positive and negative perceptions about using a smartphone. Potential factors leading to smartphone overuse included personal factors (extended free time and low self-confidence, irresponsibility/escaping certain social gatherings/passing the time); smartphone factors (reasonable price, attractive advertise-ments (ads), and engaging smartphone Apps); and social factors (social pressure and fear of losing a connection). The main negative impacts of smartphone overuse were found to be related to low academic productivity, poor physical health (body pain, lack of sleep, and low exercise), compro-mised mental well-being (stress and negative emotions), and decreased socialisation (social isolation and a reduction in face-to-face communication). Our findings suggested that awareness cam-paigns about smartphone overuse, promoting family and social events, encouraging physical activ-ities, and limiting internet use can reduce smartphone usage among university students.

According to previous work, mentoring can help detect mental problems early, such as anxiety and stress, that can trigger more severe problems. This paper seeks to analyze these aspects and the effects of the pandemic on students based on a review of previous research. Additionally, a general survey was applied to 40 students of Economics at ESPOL. The data showed that students say they feel vulnerable to psychological problems. During the covid-19 pandemic, they have increased levels of stress and anxiety due to confinement and health problems, all of which have led to low levels of academic performance and even student performance dropout.

This study assesses the impact of extended e-learning and other associated stressors on the emotional health of university students in Saudi Arabia. An online cross-sectional survey collected data between the months of January–March 2021. The emotional signs of stress were measured by using a subset of items from the COVID-19 Adolescent Symptom and Psychological Experience Questionnaire (CASPE). Data about demographic variables, educational characteristics and academic performance were also collected. A regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of emotional health. A total of 434 university students including females (63%) and males (37%) provided responses. One-third of students (33%) indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting changes including online distance studies greatly influenced their daily lives in a negative way. The regression analysis demonstrated that female students and students with average academic performance had increased vulnerability to experience emotional signs of stress (p < 0.05). The factors ‘Not going to university’ and ‘Not having a routine life’ were significant predictors of stress responses (p < 0.01) and (p < 0.001) respectively. E-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic made it possible for students to complete their studies as per academic calendar; simultaneously, it increased the vulnerability to experience stress, particularly for female students and students with average academic performance.

Objective: To determine the association between, on the one hand, the presence of depression, stress and/or suicidal ideation and, on the other, the academic performance of medical students from a Peruvian university in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: Cross-sectional, analytical and prospective study carried out in 241 students from 1st to 6th year of medicine. Data collection was carried out between March and May 2021. The presence and levels of stress, depression and risk of suicidal ideation were determined using the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (EEP-14), the Zung Scale for Depression (EZ-D) and the Beck Suicidal Ideation Scale (ISB), respectively; on the other hand, academic performance was evaluated with the Reyes Murillo learning assessment scale. A bivariate analysis was performed using the chi square test (significance level of p<0.05) to establish the association between the study variables. Results: Most of the students had an average academic performance (70.12%). The prevalence of depression, stress, and suicidal ideation was 33.61%, 94.19%, and 88.79%, respectively. Academic performance was significantly associated with the presence of depression (p=0.018), but not with the presence of stress (p=0.669), or risk of suicidal ideation (p=0.438). Conclusions: Only depression was significantly associated with academic performance, although its prevalence was much lower than stress or suicidal ideation, so it is necessary for the university to implement strategies aimed at improving the mental health of this population; this will not only improve its quality of life, but also its academic performance. © 2022, Circulo Medico de Rosario.

Method: A non-experimental, descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional quantitative design was used. Chi Square was applied to evaluate the association between variables. The sample was non-probabilistic of 166 students from nursing, nutrition and dietetics, speech therapy, and kinesiology. The abbreviated Chilean version of the DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress scales was applied, consisting of 21 items, with four response alternatives in Likert scale format and a sociodemographic questionnaire, this instrument considered personal variables, Mapuche ethnic group and level of parental education. The research protocol carried out was approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of the Del Reloncaví Health Service. Results: 54.82% of the sample presented some level of alteration or risk of suffering from anxiety, 47.59% stress and 31.33% depression. 42.17% identify themselves as belonging to the Mapuche ethnic group, while 56.02% identify themselves as non-Mapuche. Regarding the level of education of the father and mother, the highest percentage corresponds to the category of complete secondary education (father 37.95% and mother 36.14%). Conclusions: There is an association between female sex and levels of anxiety, stress and depression. In addition, there is a relationship between belonging to the female gender, studying nursing, nutrition and dietetics careers with presenting some level of anxiety. An association between anxiety, depression and stress stands out. © 2022 Sociedad de Neurologia Psiquiatria y Neurocirugia.

Its aim is to inform about strategies that help promote more adaptive behaviors towards academic assessment, as well as discuss other variables (e.g., bullying) that influence test anxiety, a typical stressor at the school and academic environment. These stressors can impair the students’ socio-cognitive development, impairing their ability to study and posing a risk to their mental health. The volume is organized in three parts. The first part brings together chapters discussing different variables and processes associated with academic anxiety, such as test anxiety and social influence, academic motivation, bullying, and procrastination. The second part is completely dedicated to psychological interventions with students designed to promote adaptive coping strategies to deal with academic anxiety and to prevent the development of psychopathologies associated with it. These interventions are based on different approaches, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, analytic behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, and mindfulness, among others. Finally, the third part presents strategies that teachers can adopt to manage academic anxiety. The Handbook of Stress and Academic Anxiety: Psychological Processes and Interventions with Students and Teachers will be a valuable resource for school and clinical psychologists, teachers, school managers and policy makers by providing information based on the best scientific evidences to help students cope with academic anxiety, prevent the development of psychopathologies associated with it and promote mental health at schools and other academic environments. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Book","Final","","Scopus"

LD also has negative effects on an individual’s learning process and social emotions. The self-efficacy and motivation of students with LD are lower than those of students without LD. Studies have reported that students with LD have poor mental health. The presence of an LD is a risk factor for mental health concerns, and the identification of mental health risks and protective factors for individuals with LD is necessary to design effective intervention models. Most previous relevant studies have recruited students without LD, and only a few have recruited those with LD. A few studies have employed multiple methods that combine person-focused strategies with variable-focused strategies because they offer complementary methodological strengths. Person-focused models can be used to identify resilient people and understand how resilience develops by comparing the resilient with those who are not, namely those who are not faring well in adverse situations and have not experienced any threats to their development. A variable-focused approach focuses on the relationship between the indices of stress or adversity and the influencing factors of resilience and psychosocial functions. In summary, person-focused methods recognize the functions of a person as a living system, whereas variable-focused methods can be used to delve deeper into specific processes. The present study attempted to use these two approaches to attain a more comprehensive understanding of resilience among students with LD. In previous studies, students with LD were not considered the reference group; thus, we lack evidence on whether the resilience of students with LD differs from that of students with LD. Finally, this study explored the resilience mechanism of students with LD and can be used as a reference to determine how to provide support and assistance to students with poor mental health. The study group of this research was composed of students with and without LD who were in grades 3 to 5 at elementary schools in Kaohsiung City. They were selected during the second semester of 2017 using the stratified purposeful sampling method. With parents’ permission, 802 students participated in this study, including 275 third graders, 269 fourth graders, and 258 fifth graders from 13 elementary schools. A total of 375 students had LD, including 113 third graders, 132 fourth graders, and 129 fifth graders from the resource classes in 55 elementary schools. Given the reading ability of students with LD, reducing the length of the questionnaire was necessary so that they could complete the survey. The study instruments included protective factors, mental health questionnaires, and academic achievement tests. The questionnaire on protective factors and mental health included five internal protective factors (i.e., physical self-concept, emotional self-concept, mathematics self-concept, Chinese self-concept, and self-efficacy) and three external protective factors (i.e., teacher support, peer support, and parental support), as well as mental health. The items in the questionnaire were scored from 4 (strongly agree) to 1 (strongly disagree), with higher scores indicating greater levels of performance. The academic achievement test included their achievements in Chinese and mathematics. These two instruments have demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity. For the person-focused approach, students with LD were classified into four groups through cluster analysis on the basis of the indices of both their mental health and academic achievement. A two-step method was applied to cluster the students. The protective factors in the different clusters of students with LD were compared. Furthermore, this study compared the protective factors in different clusters to determine whether there were significant differences between students with and without LD. For the variable-focused approach, the direct and the indirect modes were used to examine which protective factors could be used to predict the mental health of students with and without LD. A path analysis was used to test the direct and indirect model between the protective factors and mental health. In the direct model, the researcher assumes that each protective factor is positively correlated with mental health whereas the risk factors (mathematics and Chinese achievement) are negatively correlated. The indirect model was used to examine the hypothesis that self-efficacy acts as a mediator in the relationship of social support and self-concept with mental health. The main hypothesis of the variable-focused approach was tested using an application for structural equation modeling and by employing AMOS 22. Through the person-focused approach, the results obtained for the variables for students without LD were significantly higher than those for students with LD. In particular, the differences in their mental health and self-efficacy were large effect size, whereas the differences in their Chinese and mathematics achievements were more significant. After grouping the students through cluster analysis, four subgroups of students with LD were formed based on the following indicators: those high on mental health and high on academic achievement (positively adjusted, 29.26%); those high on mental health and low on academic achievement (resilient, 32.67%); those low on mental health and high on academic achievement (maladaptive, 10.80%); and those low on mental health and low on academic achievement (vulnerable, 27.27%). Students without LD were also divided into the same four groups (positively adjusted, 30.88%; resilient, 29.33%; maladaptive, 10.80%; and vulnerable, 11.24%). Regardless of whether the students had LD or not, no significant differences were observed in any protective factors for the two groups of students who were resilient and positively adjusted; however, a significant difference in academic achievement was observed. Between the two subgroups with similar low academic achievements, no significant differences in protective factors were noted. The present study discovered that students with LD and resilience had poor academic achievement but good mental health and the protective factors played a key role; among the two subgroups of students with LD with similar academic achievements, the protective factors for those at high risk were also higher. The academic achievement of the subgroup of resilient students with LD was poor, but the students exhibited better psychological adaptation than those who were maladaptive, mainly because of the protective factors. Among the two subgroups of students with LD who had similar academic achievements, the protective factors of the highly vulnerable students were lower than those of the competent students. In this study, the proportion of resilient and competent students with LD was approximately 50%. The proportion of students without LD in the resilient and competent subgroups was similar to that of students with LD. The results suggest that the protective factors are important to the mental health of both students with and without LD. Academic and cognitive difficulties do not necessarily have negative effects on the mental health of all students with LD. Declining mental health can be prevented or slowed by using protective factors, which enable students with LD to achieve different adaptation results. In the results of direct model in students without LD, emotional self-concept, Chinese self-concept, self-efficacy, and peer support predicted their mental health; by contrast, in students with LD, emotional self-concept, self-efficacy, and peer support, as well as parental support, were positively correlated with mental health. In the indirect model of students without LD, self-efficacy served as a mediator between emotional self-concept and parental support for mental health, whereas for students with LD, self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between parental support and mental health. The results of the direct model indicated that mental health was significantly associated with protective factors. Therefore, regardless of whether the students had LD or not, protective factors enhanced the mental health of individuals, although the key factors differed between the two groups. In the indirect model, the study results revealed the mediating effect of self-efficacy among students without LD on their mental health parameters, including physical self-concept, emotion self-concept, Chinese self-concept, parental support, and peer support. These parameters directly influence the individuals’ mental health and are associated with mental health through self-efficacy. Among students with LD, emotional self-concept and peer support had a direct positive correlation with their mental health, whereas parental support enhanced their mental health by bolstering their self-efficacy and, in turn, improving their mental health. Additionally, the physical and Chinese self-concepts only had a direct positive correlation with self-efficacy. Thus, the self-efficacy of the students with LD is crucial for their mental health. The results indicated that the protective factors of students with LD, such as social support and self-concepts, can enhance mental health. Finally, based on the results, this study proposes suggestions for future research and practice. © 2022, National Taiwan Normal University. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Stress can arouse strong personal emotional and behavioral responses. Compared with other groups of the same age, college students have a special way of life and living environment. They have complex interpersonal relationships and relatively weak social support systems. At the same time, they also face fierce competition in both academic and employment. However, they lack the skills to deal with the crisis and are reluctant to ask others for help, which leads to a simultaneous increase in mental stress. The pressure on college students mainly comes from study, family, social, employment, society, and economy. When students face multiple pressures from family, school, society, etc., some students are prone to some psychological problems due to their own personality or external environment and other reasons. Therefore, regular assessment of students' stress status is an important means to prevent college students' psychological problems. Considering that in real life, the number of students whose pressure is within the tolerable range is the majority, while the number of students who are under too much pressure is a minority. Therefore, the actual dataset to be identified belongs to a kind of imbalanced data. In this study, an improved extreme learning machine (IELM) is used to improve the performance of the recognition model as much as possible. IELM takes the idea of label weighting as the starting point, introduces the AdaBoost algorithm, and combines its weight distribution with the label weighted extreme learning machine (ELM). During the weight update process, the advantage of the imbalanced nature of multi-label datasets is taken. IELM was used to classify EEG data to determine the stress level of college students. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm used in this study has excellent classification performance and can accurately assess students' stress levels. The accurate assessment of stress has provided a solid foundation for the development of students' mental health and has significant practical implications. © 2022 Li Liu et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

These disparities appear to persist into adulthood and may worsen for certain subgroups, yet the mechanisms that drive these concerns remain poorly understood. Minority stress theory, the predominant model for understanding these disparities, posits that poorer outcomes are due to the stress of living in a violently homophobic and discriminatory culture. Although numerous studies report associations between minority stress and behavioural health in adolescence, no study has comprehensively examined how minority stress may change throughout the course of adolescence, nor how stress trajectories may predict health outcomes during this critical developmental period. Methods and analysis Between 15 May 2018 and 1 April 2019, we recruited a US national sample of diverse SMA (n=2558) age 14-17 through social media and respondent-driven sampling strategies. A subset of participants (n=1076) enrolled in the longitudinal component and will be followed each 6 months until 1 July 2022. Primary outcomes include symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; suicidality and self-harm and substance use. The key predictor is minority stress, operationalised as the Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory. We will use parallel cohort-sequential latent growth curve models to test study hypotheses within a developmental framework. Ethics and dissemination All participants provided assent to participate, and longitudinal participants provided informed consent at the first follow-up survey after reaching age 18. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of Southern California Social-Behavioral Institutional Review Board, including a waiver of parental permission given the potential for harm due to unintentional 'outing' to a parent during the consent process.

The present study aimed to identify the difficulties and barriers posed by mental disorders; coping strategies to overcome them, and consolidate the recommendations made by students with mental illness and their parents to make education friendlier for students with mental illness. Materials and Methods: Semi-qualitative study was conducted in the outpatient department of the Schizophrenia Research Foundation, a mental health center and nonprofit organization based in Chennai. All patients between 13 and 23 years with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder, pursuing or discontinued studies within the last 2 years were included in the study. A qualitative interview pro forma was developed and used for interviewing the patients and their family members. Results: 60.3% of the individuals interviewed had a disruption in their academic endeavor lasting for a minimum period of 2 weeks wherein they could not attend class and 1-4 such disruptions per individual in the last 2 years. Major difficulties cited by the participants were the interference of illness symptoms in academic performance, stress caused by difficulties in meeting academic requirements, and interpersonal stressors. Recommendations proposed by the participants were directed toward strategies for compensating the cognitive deficits caused by mental illness and special provisions in the examinations and evaluation. Conclusion: Acknowledging the difficulties faced by the students with mental illness and providing feasible provisions and concessions can go a long way in ensuring the students with mental illness receive a complete education. © 2022 Medknow.

Little is known about the factors that drive teachers’ use of fear appeals beyond a desire to increase motivation to excel. Aims: This study examined the relationship between the use of fear appeals, psychological distress, and self-efficacy in both teachers and students. Sample: Participants were 377 students (81% female, age range 15 to 18, M = 16.68, SD = 0.49) and 96 teachers (73% female, Mean years teaching = 18.04, SD = 12.39). Methods: Participants completed surveys mid-way through the first school term of their final year of high school. Student surveys examined student anxiety, depression, stress, self-efficacy, and experience of teacher fear appeals. Teacher surveys examined teacher anxiety, depression, stress, emotional burnout, self-efficacy, years of teaching, and use of fear appeals. Results: Teachers use of fear appeals was associated with student distress which was heightened for students with lower academic self-efficacy. Similarly, teachers’ use of fear appeals was associated with higher anxiety and lower self-efficacy in teachers themselves. Conclusions: Therefore, the use and consequence of fear appeals is strongly linked to both student and teacher self-efficacy and distress. Given the detrimental impacts of fear appeals on academic performance in vulnerable students, more research is needed on the consequences of fear appeals. © 2021 British Psychological Society.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

College students live a crucial period of transition from late adolescence to adulthood when they have to deal with important stressful tasks. Thus, university often represents a stressful environment, pushing students to cope with a high academic pressure. As a result, this period constitutes a sensitive age for the onset of mental disorders. Typically, students are not aware of the early signs of their own compromised mental health until symptoms aggravate to an overt disorder. Therefore, it is important to timely detect subthreshold symptoms mostly related to generic mental distress. Objective. First, to assess psychophysical well-being and mental distress among college students in northern Italy, and to detect predictors, among socio-demographic and academic characteristics, and risky drug use of these two outcomes. Method. The study involved 13,886 students who received an email explaining the purpose of the e-research. The questionnaires used were the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the University Stress Scale (USS), and a modified version of World Health Organization-ASSIST v3.0. Results. 3,754 students completed the web-survey. Students showed poor well-being and mental distress. The strongest predictor of mental distress and compromised well-being was physical health, followed by sex, study field, risky drug use, and academic performance concerns. Discussion and conclusion. This study shows that it is very important to promote in college students healthy behaviors in order to increase their physical exercise and reduce substance use. Moreover, it would be desirable to improve academic counselling facilities as an important front-line service to intercept mental health issues among young adults © 2022, Salud Mental.All Rights Reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We investigated the impact of maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as paternal emotional problems on the educational outcomes of their adolescent and young adult offspring. Methods: We used data from a longitudinal birth cohort recruited between 1989 and 1991 in Australia (the Raine Study). The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale was used to assess maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms, and a self-reported question was used to measure paternal mental health problems. Both were assessed when the offspring was aged 10 years. Outcomes included offspring’s self-reported education attainment—not completing year 10 at age 17, not attending tertiary education at ages 17 and 22 and primary caregiver’s reports of offspring’s academic performance at age 17. Results: A total of 1033, 1307 and 1364 parent–offspring pairs were included in the final analysis exploring the association between parental mental health problems and offspring’s academic performance at school, completing year 10 and attending tertiary education, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, the offspring of mothers with anxiety symptoms were 3.42 times more likely than the offspring of mothers without anxiety symptoms to have poor or below-average academic performance (odds ratio = 3.42; 95% confidence interval = [1.31, 8.92]) and more than 2 times more likely to not attend tertiary education (odds ratio = 2.55; 95% confidence interval = [1.10, 5.5.88]) and not to have completed year 10 (odds ratio = 2.13; 95% confidence interval = [1.04, 4.33]). We found no significant associations between maternal depressive symptoms or paternal emotional problems and offspring educational attainment. Conclusion: Maternal anxiety symptoms, but not depression and paternal emotional problems, are associated with poor educational attainment and achievement in adolescent offspring. The findings highlight that efforts to improve the outcomes of offspring of mothers with anxiety could focus on educational attainment. © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2021.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study aims to assess factors associated with perceived stress in Italian MSs. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 Italian medical schools (MSCs) in November 2018. A questionnaire assessed socio-demographic characteristics, habits, opinions about MSC, and concerns about the future. Stress was assessed with the PSS-10. Descriptive and univariable tests were performed. A linear model was fitted to find associations of the PSS-10 score with characteristics. There were 2513 collected questionnaires. Median PSS-10 score was 18 (IQR 11). Median age was 22 (IQR 4) and 61% of the sample was female. Female gender, being part of a sexual minority, poor financial situation, competitive atmosphere, having hobbies, resting, and sleeping hindered by MSC were characteristics associated with higher PSS-10 scores. Current relationship, good family relationship, and no concerns about the future were protective factors. Being part of sexual minorities had greater effects in students not living away from home, while in the other group it was not having satisfying friendships. Medical students suffer higher levels of stress than the general population, and many MSC stressors are associated. Living away from home modifies risk and protective factors, offering the possibility to tailor group-specific interventions. © 2022 by the authors.

Physical activity (PA) can be a promising strategy to buffer these stress-induced complaints. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to summarize evidence for the tridimensional construct of PA, stress, and AP, as well as to quantify the relationships among these variables. Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, SMEI, ERIC, andWeb of Science) were systematically searched in November 2019 for publications that examined PA, stress, and AP of university students, without any restrictions regarding the publication period. The systematic review includes four original research studies with a moderateto- high risk of bias. Results of included studies were narratively summarized and quantified in a meta-analysis using random effect models. Whereas study results point to a positive relation between PA and AP, relationships between PA and stress seem to be negative, while the relation between stress and AP is undecided. The meta-analysis found no significant associations and considerable heterogeneity of the results. Findings indicate a research gap concerning the connection of PA, stress, and AP in university students. Future studies should use validated measuring tools and consider the timepoint of data collection in order to extract truly stressful periods. © 2021 by the authors.

In total, 398 (79%) of the survivors participated in one or more of the four data collections in the study. Their mean age at the time of the terrorist attack was 19.2 years (SD=4.3, range 13.1–56.7, 94.0% < 26 years of age), and 49.0% were female. The vast majority (88.9%) were of Norwegian origin. Participants were interviewed face-to-face at 4-5 months (T1), 14-15 months (T2), 30-32 months (T3), and 8.5 years (T4), post-attack. We found that the terrorist attack had negative repercussions for the survivors’ mental and somatic health for years after the attack, including symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, complicated grief, headache, and other somatic symptoms. Exposure to the attack also led to long-term functional impairment for many, particularly in relation to the survivors’ academic performance and well-being at school. Furthermore, it had negative health consequences for people close to the survivors, such as their caregivers. An important factor associated with how survivors cope after a terrorist attack is the support and help they receive from their social network, but also from the health care system. In line with the national health outreach plan, most survivors had received early proactive outreach from their municipality, but many missed a broader and longer lasting follow-up. The comprehensive documentation of short- and long-term health and social consequences in this study underlines the challenges societies are faced with after terrorist attacks. This insight calls for actions from decision makers in providing adequate outreach programs in health and social services. In particular, survivors with a non- Norwegian origin reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms and were less satisfied with the follow-up. After future attacks, the official outreach should be proactive, long lasting, and consider the diverse needs and characteristics of the affected individuals. For example, there should be a particular focus on survivors with a minority background. Furthermore, the outreach should be broad, and include people in the survivors’ immediate social network, schools and workplaces. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The sample group consists of students of Kurdistan University of medical sciences. 430 students at Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences were selected randomly to participate in the present cross-sectional study in 2016. We used General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and Achievement motivation test (AMT) as the measures of our study. Our findings indicated that mental health is significantly correlated with achievement motivation (p <.001), but has no correlation with educational success (p =.37). Also, a significant relationship was observed between achievement motivation and academic achievement (p =.025). GHQ was not correlated with demographic factors, while academic achievement and achievement motivation are associated with the field of study and marital status respectively. Conclusively, students who are more motivated to achieve their educational and academic goals, will be more likely to be successful in their education and have stronger academic performance. Also, students with more appropriate mental health status will have higher level of motivation in their education and studies.

College students (n = 498) self-reported their general and source-specific stress mindsets, perceived distress, health, coping, and GPA. Stress mindsets varied as a function of duration and controllability, and general stress mindsets were only weakly associated with source-specific mindsets. Consistent with previous research, general stress mindsets were associated with health, but some source-specific mindsets were more predictive of health than others—viewing stress from chronic controllable sources as debilitating was most predictive of poor mental and physical health. Measures of stress were also associated with health, and this association was moderated by stress mindsets, suggesting that viewing stress as enhancing can provide a psychological “buffer” against the negative effects of stress. Approach coping and perceived distress were examined as potential mediators of the links between stress mindset and health. Viewing stress as enhancing was related to greater use of approach coping and lower perceived distress, which in turn was related to better health. This research suggests that stress mindset interventions may benefit students’ health, and that interventions targeting mindsets for chronic controllable sources of stress may be more effective than general stress mindset interventions. © 2021 Jenkins et al.

This study explores common mental health problems experienced during this stage and assesses how they cope with problems and their expectations from health services. This was a cross-sectional study involving 393 Indonesians aged 16–24 years in May 2020. More than 90% of students had financial and academic difficulties and felt lonely. The most prevalent mental health problem among students was anxiety (95.4%). Most of the students, ranging from 90% to 96.4%, had positive coping strategies. However, around 50% of respondents reported self-harming and having suicidal thoughts. The results of subcategories analysis between ages and faculties were similar. Their most important expectations from mental health services included confidentiality (99.2%) and being wel-coming and friendly (99.2%). In conclusion, this study highlighted the most common problems tran-sitional-age youth experience in Indonesia. While some of them already knew how to deal with their problems, not all the participants had good coping mechanisms.

Factors known to be associated with this high burden range from social to poor academic performance. Thus, this study sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of depression and perceived stress among university students attending a Caribbean university. This was a cross-sectional study involving 800 students. Depression was assessed using the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and perceived stress was assessed using the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between predictors on depression and perceived stress. The BDI score was 11.97 ± 8.77 with a prevalence of depression at 25.88% and perceived stress of 57.50%. Living or associating with family and friends, were significant predictors of depression while school, money and associating with family/friends were significant for perceived stress. Talking with someone and exercise were associated with a lower likelihood of depression, while eating, drinking alcohol and shopping were associated with reduced levels of perceived stress. The level of depression and perceived high stress in this populations was moderate compared to similar international populations. These findings can be used to inform and design future interventions to improve the mental health of university students. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In addition, AD has an impact on direct and indirect healthcare resource utilization. Several studies have attempted to quantify the quality of life and direct/indirect economic burden of AD. However, these estimates may not capture the more intangible disease-related burden and associated economic burden. This was a qualitative case report that aimed to investigate the full lifetime impact of severe, uncontrolled AD on all aspects of a single patient’s life. This case report emphasizes the enormous cumulative lifetime impact of severe, uncontrolled AD and where the qualitative indirect impact may not be fully captured. After obtaining consent, a patient, diagnosed with severe AD since birth, was asked close- and open-ended questions about AD history, direct and indirect healthcare resource utilization, and impact of AD on work, home, family, social life, daily functioning, and mental health over the course of her lifetime. Our patient attributed her severe, uncontrolled AD since birth to causing poor sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and difficulty with social connections and to her choosing an alternative, less physically demanding career. Early effects on sleep and school performance, along with impact on social connections, likely contribute to weaker career opportunities and further social isolation with age. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Much research in Europe reported that around 30% of medical students suffered from anxiety. Anxiety disorders have significant physical and emotional consequences. Various studies show that excessive, unmanaged stress related to poor academic performance in medical students leads to cynical personalities, lack of empathy, and suicidal ideas. AIM: This study aimed to identify studies for psychotherapy interventions carried out in medical students and analyze each impact on anxiety level in medical students. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted with evidence sourced from 2000 to 2020. The review process followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The study was registered with the Prospective Registering of Systematic Reviews database (Protocol ID: CRD42020180650). RESULTS: Twenty-three studies meet the inclusion criteria, and there are various psychotherapy interventions to deal with anxiety. Most studies reported that students who received mindfulness-based interventions reported lower anxiety, depression, and stress. CONCLUSION: There are various interventions carried out to decrease stress levels, depression, and anxiety in medical students. The most effective psychotherapy was found in cognitive and behavior intervention and mindfulness intervention. © 2021 Andrian Fajar Kusumadewi, Carla Raymondalexas Marchira, Widyandana Widyandana, Ronny Tri Wirasto.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

To present a review of the scientific literature on the problem of studying students’ coping behavior in the situation of Covid-19 pandemic, approaches as well as program of interdisciplinary research of students’ coping strategies during urgent transition to distance learning in the conditions of anti-epidemic measures. Results. The characteristic of the ways of revealing productive coping-strategies under stress is given with the allocation of conditions, evaluation of the situation, resources which are available for students. From the point of view of medical and hygienic research when assessing coping behavior, individual indicators of physical, mental health, lifestyle, hygienic skills and standards should be taken into account. When assessing psychological and pedagogical factors of coping behavior one should pay attention to academic performance, peculiarities of social and psychological in-teraction with classmates and teachers, socio-economic status, gender and personal characteristics of the individual. Conclusion. The interdisciplinary medical-psychological-pedagogical approach to the study of students’ coping behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic causes the construction of a typology of coping behavior, allows to identify productive and non-productive coping strategies for coping with stressful situations, to determine and describe additional factors influencing their choice. The development of recommen-dations on the application of the typology of coping strategies obtained on the basis of interdisciplinary scientific approach, will allow the administration of universities to reasonably approach the development of medical-hygienic and psychological-ped-agogical preventive measures in the design of the educational environment in the conditions of the pandemic. © 2021, Science and Innovation Center Publishing House.

Methods: a bibliographic study was carried out through a qualitative research in three VHL, Lilacs and Scielo databases. The descriptors Children, Pandemic, Caregivers, Distance education and Mental health were used. The sample was composed of 35 materials. Results: it was observed that countries presented problems in its educational system and that their situation also aggravated, such as in Brazil. Schools should try to mitigate the impact of the confinement, based on the recommendations that aim to consolidate what has been learned and interrupt the teaching of new content, eliminating the pressure on parents and guardians who assist students at this time. It is known that there is a lack of preparation of these caregivers, since the vast majority do not have materials or available time, because of home office, making remote learning difficult. The psychological impacts of remote learning-stress, fear, decreased performance and frustration are noticeable in everyone who is involved. Thus, the coping strategy focused on the problem can prevent the worsening of symptoms in mental health.

As a secondary objective, a new instrument, Medical Student Stress Factor Scale (MSSF), was developed based on these stressors. Methods: The MSSF was applied to 431 medical students. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale was administered to investigate the relationship between these stressors and the students’ mental health. Results: The five greatest stressors were the extensive content, lack of time to study, sleep deprivation, excessive self-pressure for good grades, and lack of leisure time. The MSSF showed good psychometric characteristics, resulting in a 28-item scale with five subscales. The Relationships and Health subscales were associated with depressive symptoms; Relationships, Health, and Learning Environment/Academic Performance were associated with anxiety symptoms, while Health, and Learning Environment/Academic Performance were associated with stress symptoms. Conclusions: Our study presents important data about the most important stressors that affect medical students’ lives and cause mental health issues. The factors are generally related to academic performance and the learning environment and should be targeted in future interventions. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Psiquiatria.

Methods: Data gathering was performed utilizing an online questionnaire during imposed confinement. A correlational design with incidental sampling for convenience was used. All the variables were analyzed by age, gender, academic training, type of participation and sport specialty on a population composed of 447 Olympic (age: 26.0 ± 7.5 years) and 64 Paralympic (age: 28.4 ± 10.5 years) athletes. Results: The athletes trained more than twice as many hours before than during confinement. Most of the athletes recognized that their best athletic performance diminished due to the COVID-19 confinement but that will recover after the pandemic and its confinements. Almost half of the athletes declared they were more tired than normal and had difficulty sleeping, while more than half ate more or less as usual. Paralympic athletes reported they felt more capable to cope with personal problems and life events and felt less lonely during the confinement than the Olympians. The athletes from team sports reported to be more affected in their training routine than athletes of individual sports, seeing their athletic performance more affected. Athletes in individual sports felt more able to cope with personal problems than athletes in team sports. Female athletes were significantly more tired and reported more difficulty sleeping than male athletes. Conclusion: The situation caused by COVID-19 has had significant effects on the behavior, perception of threat, stress and training patterns of Olympic and Paralympic athletes preparing for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. It is necessary that sports institutions reinforce mechanisms of help for athletes during future situations of confinement. © 2021 by the authors.

This study examined the relation between primary caregivers’ mental health and school-aged children’s outcomes, including student mental health, resilience, and academic performance, in rural China. Using cross-sectional data from economically poor areas in the Gansu province, 2989 students (mean age = 11.51, 53.33% male, 46.67% female) and their primary caregivers (74.2% female) completed the 21-item, self-report Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Students also completed the 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and a standardized math test. The results indicated a high prevalence of caregiver depression (31%), stress (39%), and anxiety (24%). Characteristics that were significantly correlated with caregiver mental health issues included being a grandparent, having a low socioeconomic status and low education level, and living in a household with at least one migrant worker. Apart from caregiver stress and student resilience, caregiver mental health issues were negatively correlated with all student outcomes, including student mental health, resilience, and academic performance. Although additional empirical research is needed to investigate the associations between caregiver mental health and student outcomes, our results suggest that rural communities could benefit greatly from programs focused on improving the mental health of caregivers and this, in turn, may have a positive impact on student outcomes. © 2021 by the authors.

This study examines their psychological impact on university students in Asia. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between April and May 2020 in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, India and Indonesia. The Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and questions on adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies were used in this study. A total of 3,679 students from the seven countries participated in this study. Overall, 21.9% and 13.7% of the students in this study experienced mild to moderate and severe to extreme levels of anxiety. More than 20% of the students from China and Bangladesh reported severe to extreme level of anxiety compared to below 10% of the students from Indonesia, Malaysia and India. Among the female students, 15.9% experienced severe to extreme level of anxiety compared to 10.6% among the males. Females from Bangladesh, China, Malaysia, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia experienced significantly higher levels of anxiety compared to their male counterparts. Acceptance was the most used and Seeking Social Support was the least used coping strategies among the students. There were significant differences in the usage of the four strategies by countries. Stressors are predominantly financial constraints, remote online learning, and uncertainty related to their academic performance, and future career prospects  Copyright © 2021 Chinna et al.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Men in this age group have been healthy much of their lives, and a diagnosis of cancer can cause significant psychosocial distress. We therefore sought to examine the psychosocial needs of patients with germ cell tumour and determine whether needs vary based on age (AYA vs non-AYA). We hypothesized that AYA experience more anxiety and distress in emotional, practical and physical domains. Methods: We evaluated the responses of all patients referred to British Columbia (BC) Cancer who completed a pre-consultation health assessment form. This is a validated screening questionnaire for distress, subclinical/clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety and includes the Canadian Problem Checklist domains of emotional, informational, practical, spiritual, social/family and physical concerns. Results: Data were collected for 349 patients (2011–2015). Patient population was predominantly AYA (n = 227) with median age 33 (range 18–83). The top 3 AYA concerns were financial, work/school, frustration and anger. AYA patients more commonly scored positive for symptoms of subclinical/clinical anxiety than non-AYA (39.4% vs. 27.9%, p = 0.028). Those AYA patients with subclinical/clinical anxiety symptoms experienced more fears and worries, concerns regarding work/school, lack of understanding of their disease, finances and frustration and anger. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that AYA with testicular cancer have unique needs and experience more self-reported anxiety symptoms with emotional, informational and practical concerns. This is valuable information to stakeholders for allocation of resources to address cancer survivorship amongst these patients. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

We surveyed at the time of resumption of fertility care the psychological experience and coping strategies of patients pausing their care due to Covid-19 and examined which factors were associated and predictive of resilience, anxiety, stress and hopefulness. Methods: Cross sectional cohort patient survey using an anonymous, self-reported, single time, web-based, HIPPA compliant platform (REDCap). Survey sampled two Northeast academic fertility practices (Yale Medicine Fertility Center in CT and Montefiore’s Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Health in NY). Data from multiple choice and open response questions collected demographic, reproductive history, experience and attitudes about Covid-19, prior infertility treatment, sense of hopefulness and stress, coping strategies for mitigating stress and two validated psychological surveys to assess anxiety (six-item short-form State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAl-6)) and resilience (10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, (CD-RISC-10). Results: Seven hundred thirty-four patients were sent invitations to participate. Two hundred fourteen of 734 (29.2%) completed the survey. Patients reported their fertility journey had been delayed a mean of 10 weeks while 60% had been actively trying to conceive > 1.5 years. The top 5 ranked coping skills from a choice of 19 were establishing a daily routine, going outside regularly, exercising, maintaining social connection via phone, social media or Zoom and continuing to work. Having a history of anxiety (p < 0.0001) and having received oral medication as prior infertility treatment (p < 0.0001) were associated with lower resilience. Increased hopefulness about having a child at the time of completing the survey (p < 0.0001) and higher resilience scores (p < 0.0001) were associated with decreased anxiety. Higher reported stress scores (p < 0.0001) were associated with increased anxiety. Multiple multivariate regression showed being non-Hispanic black (p = 0.035) to be predictive of more resilience while variables predictive of less resilience were being a full-time homemaker (p = 0.03), having received oral medication as prior infertility treatment (p = 0.003) and having higher scores on the STAI-6 (< 0.0001). Conclusions: Prior to and in anticipation of further pauses in treatment the clinical staff should consider pretreatment screening for psychological distress and provide referral sources. In addition, utilization of a patient centered approach to care should be employed. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: This was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study that included undergraduate medical students of a public sector medical university in Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 573 students participated voluntarily, of which 300 were provided a manual questionnaire and 273 filled it online. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha at 0.791. The collected data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0. Results: Out of 573 participants, 99.3% (n = 298) of students filled the questionnaire manually, whereas 100% of students filled the questionnaire online. Almost two-thirds of students used university transport; more than 90% lived more than 5 km from the university and 56% had a traveling time of more than an hour. Approximately 15.4% of students reported physical trauma and some form of harassment. Sheldon Cohen’s stress scale surprisingly revealed 90% of students to be within the moderate-to-high stress category. Risk factors were associated with stress levels and significant associations were observed with noise exposure (P = 0.023) and sleep quality (P = 0.001). The most common reported stressors associated with commuting included overcrowding, long travel, and air and noise pollution. Noise pollution was the main predictor of stress among commuters. Conclusion: Poor transportation has adverse effects on health and academic performance. Administration in their respective jurisdictions is needed to investigate this matter to make commuting a routine rather than a hassle. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study aimed to investigate the psychological well-being and distress and related factors among undergraduate students training in eight different health-related tracks in Geneva, Switzerland. Methods: This cross-sectional study used established self-filled scales for anxiety, depression, stress, psychological well-being, and study satisfaction. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression analyses were applied. Results: In Octo-ber 2019, out of 2835 invited students, 915 (32%) completed the survey. Lower academic satisfaction scores were strongly associated with depression (β = −0.26, p < 0.001), anxiety (β = −0.27, p < 0.001), and stress (β = −0.70, p < 0.001), while higher scores were associated with psychological well-being (β = 0.70, p < 0.001). Being female was strongly associated with anxiety and stress but not with depression or psychological well-being. Increased age was associated with enhanced psychological well-being. The nature of the academic training had a lesser impact on mental health and the academic year had none. Conclusion: Academic satisfaction strongly predicts depression, anxiety, stress, and psychological well-being. Training institutions should address the underlying factors that can improve students’ satisfaction with their studies while ensuring that they have access to psychosocial services that help them cope with mental distress and enhance their psychological well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

Prevention and early treatment of mental health problems in college students is therefore a key public health priority, nationally and internationally. Developing a range of evidence-based interventions targeting the mental health of students is critical. We examined the feasibility and acceptability of a new universal time use and well-being intervention, the 'Everyday Matters: Healthy Habits for University Life' digital badge (EMDB), a co-curricular micro-credential for first-year college students. Methods: This study used a single-Arm, pre-post design for first-year undergraduate students. The EMDB comprised eight 1-hour lunchtime sessions on brain development and time-use habits across the 24 hours of the day including sleep, self-care, leisure, study and work. Validated measures of occupational competence and value, mental well-being, sleep health, mindset, self-compassion and gratitude were completed, along with an evaluation questionnaire. Results: Eight first-year undergraduate students completed the demographic questionnaire and pre-and post-measures, with one additional student completing only the evaluation questionnaire. There was significantly improved levels of well-being, self-compassion and growth mindset following the intervention. Many of the challenges reported by participants related to occupational issues such as managing finances and having a satisfying routine. Participants appreciated the practical relevance and scientific underpinnings of the programme content. The sense of belonging within the group and having insightful conversations with other group members were particularly valued by participants. Conclusions: This study offers preliminary evidence that an occupational therapy based universal time-use and well-being intervention was feasible to deliver and acceptable to first-year undergraduate students. The results of this study and the participant acceptability support further development and evaluation of the EMDB intervention.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Inadequacies in mental health care delivery result in prolonged illness, disease progression, poorer prognosis, and greater likelihood of relapse, highlighting the need for a new approach to detect mental health problems and engage college students in services. We have developed a transdiagnostic, low-cost mobile mental health targeted prevention and intervention platform that uses population-level screening to engage college students in tailored services that address common mental health problems. We will test the impact of this mobile mental health platform for service delivery in a large-scale trial across 20+ colleges. Students who screen positive or at high-risk for clinical anxiety, depression, or an eating disorder and who are not currently engaged in mental health services (N = 7884) will be randomly assigned to: 1) intervention via the mobile mental health platform; or 2) referral to usual care (i.e., campus health or counseling center). We will test whether the mobile mental health platform, compared to referral, is associated with improved uptake, reduced clinical cases, disorder-specific symptoms, and improved quality of life and functioning. We will also test mediators, predictors, and moderators of improved mental health outcomes, as well as stakeholder-relevant outcomes, including cost-effectiveness and academic performance.

These obligations could severely affect their mental health. The purpose of this study was to examine the mental health status of undergraduate nursing students and related factors. A total of 1368 nursing students from different universities in Spain and Chile were included in this study, which took place over the 2018–2019 academic year. We assessed their levels of stress related to specific learning methodologies and determined their mental health status using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). The results revealed that the more advanced the course was, the lower the total GHQ-28 score. The stress generated by different types of training activities had a significant effect on the total GHQ-28 score. These results suggest that nursing education could act as a protective factor against mental health disorders.

Behavioral addictions operate on a modified principle of the classic addiction model. The problem is not well investigated in Ethiopia. So the present study aimed to assess the prevalence of internet addiction and associated factors among university students in Ethiopia. Objectives: Main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of internet addiction among University Students in Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Wollo University students from April 10 to May 10, 2019. A total of 603 students were participated in the study using a structured questionnaire. A multistage cluster sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. A binary logistic regression method was used to explore associated factors for internet addiction and variables with a p value < 0.25 in the bivariate analysis were fitted to the multi-variable logistic regression analysis. The strength of association between internet addiction and associated factors was assessed with odds ratio, 95% CI and p value < 0.05 in the final model was considered significant. Results: The prevalence of internet addiction (IA) among the current internet users was 85% (n = 466). Spending more time on the internet (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 10.13, 95% CI 1.33–77.00)), having mental distress (AOR = 2.69, 95% CI 1.02–7.06), playing online games (AOR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.38–4.18), current khat chewing (AOR = 3.34, 95% CI 1.14–9.83) and current alcohol use (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.09–4.92) were associated with internet addiction. Conclusions: The current study documents a high prevalence of internet addiction among Wollo University students. Factors associated with internet addiction were spending more time, having mental distress, playing online games, current khat chewing, and current alcohol use. As internet addiction becomes an evident public health problem, carrying out public awareness campaigns may be a fruitful strategy to decrease its prevalence and effect. Besides to this, a collaborative work among stakeholders is important to develop other trendy, adaptive, and sustainable countermeasures. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, elevated performance monitoring is associated with increased checking behaviors and perfectionism and is characteristic of multiple psychiatric disorders. Understanding how heightened performance monitoring in early childhood relates to subsequent brain connectivity may elucidate mechanistic risk factors that influence brain and psychiatric outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the association between performance monitoring in preschool-aged children and functional connectivity during adolescence. In the current prospective longitudinal study, we performed seed-based functional connectivity analysis using a dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) seed to assess brain–behavior relationships between observationally coded performance monitoring in preschool-aged children and adolescent functional connectivity (n = 79). We also utilized enrichment analysis to investigate network-level connectome-wide associations. Seed-based analysis revealed negative correlations between preschool performance monitoring and adolescent fc between dACC and orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while a positive correlation was observed between dACC-occipital cortex connectivity. Enrichment analysis revealed a negative correlation between preschool performance monitoring and connectivity between motor (MOT) - cingulo-opercular (CO) and salience (SN) - Reward (REW) and a positive correlation with MOT-DMN, and cerebellum (CB) - motor connectivity. Elevated performance monitoring in early childhood is associated with functional connectivity during adolescence in regions and networks associated with cognitive control, sensorimotor processing and cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortico (CTSC) aberrations. These regions and networks are implicated in psychiatric disorders characterized by elevated performance monitoring. Findings shed light on a mechanistic risk factor in early childhood with long-term associations with neural functioning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, much less is known about factors early in life that may protect from poor mental health outcomes in midlife. This study aimed to identify the extent to which a set of key perinatal demographic variables and adolescent academic performance were associated with good mental health in mid-adulthood. Methods: In a sample of 525 individuals (aged 34-44, 55.4% male) born and raised in Jerusalem, Israel (STREAM study) we attempted to differentiate those who did and did not report psychiatric symptoms in mid-adulthood. Using χ2 and regression analysis, we explored birth factors (year of birth, sex, birth weight, and number of older siblings, data on parental immigration and socioeconomic status), academic achievement in eighth grade and contemporaneous measures of lifestyle factors, personality traits, and perceived resilience. Results: Participants with good mental health were more often male (P =.005) and had better academic performance already at adolescence than participants who reported psychiatric symptoms in midlife (P <.001). They reported fewer physical complaints (P =.008), were less likely to smoke (P =.001) and considered themselves to be more “resilient” (P <.001). Conclusions: The results showed that better academic performance in adolescence may be associated with better stress-coping strategies, resulting in fewer psychiatric complaints, more perceived resilience, and less stress-related behaviours in mid-adulthood. Future studies confirming this hypothesis could inform public mental health interventions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The high prevalence of food insecurity is a threat to students’ health and success. Therefore, this study aims to determine an association between food security status, psychosocial factors, and academic performance among university students. A total of 663 undergraduate students in seven randomly selected faculties in Universiti Putra Malaysia participated in this study. An online survey was conducted to obtain demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, food security status (six-item USDA; food security survey module, FSSM), psychosocial factors (depression, anxiety and stress scale, DASS-21) and academic performance. Among the abovementioned participating students, 32.4% are male. About 62.8% reported to have experienced food insecurity. Binary logistic regression revealed that students whose fathers were working (AOR = 6.446, 95% CI: 1.22, 34.01) came from low-(AOR = 14.314, 95% CI: 1.565, 130.954) and middle-income groups (AOR = 15.687, 95% CI: 1.720, 143.092), and those receiving financial aid (AOR = 2.811, 95% CI: 1.602, 4.932) were associated with food insecurity. Additionally, food insecurity students were less-likely reported, with CGPA ≥ 3.7 (AOR = 0.363, 95% CI: 1.22–34.014). Food insecurity respondents had higher odds for stress (AOR = 1.562, 95% CI: 1.111, 2.192), anxiety (AOR = 3.046, 95% CI: 2.090, 4.441), and depression (AOR = 2.935, 95% CI: 2.074, 4.151). The higher institutions should identify students with food insecurity problems and future intervention programs need to be conducted to combat food insecurity among students, thus yielding benefits to their health and success. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it has recently been proposed as a personality trait that relates to better mental health and work performance. In the current investigation, we examined the role of IM in buffering depression-related social stress and predicting individual’s adaptive work behaviors. Through 3 studies in a large sample (N = 2,317) in a real postgraduate enrollment context and 1 follow-up study, we found that IM moderated the associations of depression with 2 stressors related to lack of tangible and intangible stress-coping resources. The associations of depression with social support and socioeconomic status were weaker among individuals with higher IM tendency (Study 1). IM also predicted more perseverance in solving highly difficult problems (Study 2) and enduring boredom (Study 3), which was thought to be adaptive and crucial in achieving occupational success. Furthermore, we also showed that IM in the selection context predicted better adjustment and performance in real academic life after the enrollment (Study 4). These findings demonstrate the positive role of IM in making inferences about applicants’ mental health and potential work performances, which is the top issue in personnel selection practices. © 2019 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Residents are at high risk of developing depression owing to the stressful nature of their medical practice and academic training. Depression in medical residents leads to decreased clinical efficiency, and poor academic performance; it can also lead to substance abuse and suicide. Our primary aim was to measure depression prevalence among medical residents in Kenya’s largest national teaching and referral hospital. Secondary aims were to describe how depression was associated with perceived stress, perceived social support, substance use, and educational environment. Methods: We sampled 338 residents belonging to 8 different specialties using self administered questionnaires in this cross-sectional survey between October 2019 and February 2020. Questionnaires included: sociodemographics, the Centres for Epidemiology Depression Scale - Revised, Perceived Stress Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test, and Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression were used to assess for risk factors for depression. Results: Mean participant age was 31.8 years and 53.4% were males. Most residents (70.4%) reported no to mild depressive symptoms, 12.7% had moderate, and 16.9% had severe depressive symptoms. Most residents had high social support (71.8%) and moderate stress (61.6%). The educational environment was rated as more positive than negative by 46.3% of residents. Bivariate analyses revealed significant correlations between depressive symptoms, perceived stress, substance use, perceived social support, and educational environment. Multivariate analysis showed that depression was strongly associated with: fewer hours of sleep (β = − 0.683, p = 0.002), high perceived stress (β = 0.709, p < 0.001) and low perceived social support (β = − 2.19, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Only 30% of medical residents in our study had moderate and severe depressive symptoms. Most residents in our study reported high levels of social support, and moderate levels of stress. Though their overall appraisal of medical residency experience was positive, mental health support and self-care skills in the training of medical professionals needs prioritization. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Using longitudinal data from a cohort of children (N = 12,288, mean age = 14.56 years) of nurses, this study examined associations between the types of schools participants attended in adolescence and a wide range of subsequent psychological well-being, social engagement, character strengths, mental health, health behavior and physical health outcomes. Results in this sample suggested little difference between attending private independent schools and public schools across outcomes in young adulthood. There were, however, notable differences in subsequent outcomes comparing homeschooling and public schools, and possibly some evidence comparing religious schools and public schools. Specifically, there was some evidence that attending religious schools versus public schools was associated with a higher likelihood of frequent religious service attendance and becoming registered voters, a lower risk of overweight/obese, fewer lifetime sexual partners, and a higher risk of subsequently being binge drinkers; however, these associations were not robust to correction for multiple testing. Homeschooling compared with public schooling was associated with subsequently more frequent volunteering (ß = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.15, 0.52), greater forgiveness (ß = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.16, 0.46), and more frequent religious service attendance (Risk Ratio [RR] = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.80), and possibly also with greater purpose in life, less marijuana use, and fewer lifetime sexual partners, but negatively associated with college degree attainment (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.88) and possibly with greater risk of posttraumatic stress disorder. These results may encourage education stakeholders to consider a wider range of outcomes beyond academic performance in decision-making. © 2021 Chen et al.

Here we provide a systematic review of risk factors for violence in adolescents using the risk factor categories from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment study. Further, we provide clinical guidance for assessing adolescent violence risk in the pediatric ED. Methods: For this systematic review, we used the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2009 checklist. We searched PubMed and PsycINFO databases (1966-July 1, 2020) for studies that reported risk factors for violence in adolescents. Results: Risk factors for adolescent violence can be organized by MacArthur risk factor categories. Personal characteristics include male gender, younger age, no religious affiliation, lower IQ, and Black, Hispanic, or multiracial race. Historical characteristics include a younger age at first offense, higher number of previous criminal offenses, criminal history in one parent, physical abuse, experiencing poor child-rearing, and low parental education level. Among contextual characteristics, high peer delinquency or violent peer- group membership, low grade point average and poor academic performance, low connectedness to school, truancy, and school failure, along with victimization, are risk factors. Also, firearm access is a risk factor for violence in children and adolescents. Clinical characteristics include substance use, depressive mood, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, antisocial traits, callous/unemotional traits, grandiosity, and justification of violence.

With an increasing number of traumatic event types experienced (trauma load), PTSD risk increases in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, high rates of PTSD can impair the reconstruction process in post-conflict societies. In order to meet these high needs for mental health services in societies with little access to professional care, task shifting approaches and community-based interventions have been suggested. Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) has been developed as a short and pragmatic exposure-based PTSD treatment that can be easily trained to lay personnel. Yet, it remains unclear whether NET can be effectively provided by trained lay counsellors even at high levels of trauma load. Objective: To investigate whether trauma load influences the treatment effectiveness of NET provided by trained and supervised local lay counsellors. Method: Linear mixed models were calculated to investigate the influence of trauma load on treatment effectiveness in a sample of N = 323 rebel war survivors from Northern Uganda with PTSD. Results: We found a strong reduction of PTSD symptoms following NET, which was not influenced by trauma load. However, individuals with higher levels of trauma load reported higher PTSD symptoms before therapy as well as 4 and 10 months following treatment completion compared to individuals with lower trauma load. Conclusions: Treatment with NET by lay counsellors is effective independent of trauma load. However, individuals with higher trauma load have a higher probability to show residual symptoms, which might require additional time, sessions or treatment modules. © 2020 The Author(s).

Many studies have been conducted to predict the prevalence of stress among university students, however most of these analyses were predominantly performed using the basic logistic regression (LR) model. As an alternative, we used the advanced machine learning (ML) approaches for detecting significant risk factors and to predict the prevalence of stress among Bangladeshi university students. Methods: This prevalence study surveyed 355 students from twenty-eight different Bangladeshi universities using questions concerning anthropometric measurements, academic, lifestyles, and health-related information, which referred to the perceived stress status of the respondents (yes or no). Boruta algorithm was used in determining the significant prognostic factors of the prevalence of stress. Prediction models were built using decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and LR, and their performances were evaluated using parameters of confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and k-fold cross-validation techniques. Results: One-third of university students reported stress within the last 12 months. Students’ pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, sleep status, smoking status, and academic background were selected as the important features for predicting the prevalence of stress. Evaluated performance revealed that the highest performance observed from RF (accuracy = 0.8972, precision = 0.9241, sensitivity = 0.9250, specificity = 0.8148, area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.8715, k-fold accuracy = 0.8983) and the lowest from LR (accuracy = 0.7476, precision = 0.8354, sensitivity = 0.8250, specificity = 0.5185, AUC = 0.7822, k-fold accuracy = 07713) and SVM with polynomial kernel of degree 2 (accuracy = 0.7570, precision = 0.7975, sensitivity = 0.8630, specificity = 0.5294, AUC = 0.7717, k-fold accuracy = 0.7855). Overall, the RF model performs better and authentically predicted stress compared with other ML techniques, including individual and interaction effects of predictors. Conclusion: The machine learning framework can be detected the significant prognostic factors and predicted this psychological problem more accurately, thereby helping the policy-makers, stakeholders, and families to understand and prevent this serious crisis by improving policy-making strategies, mental health promotion, and establishing effective university counseling services. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The aim of the PENSAMI study is to not only cure the disease, but to also care for the person from a clinical and psychosocial perspective. Data will be collected from 150 paediatric patients affected by heart disease, diabetes, and asthma admitted during in-hospital stay or outpatient visits, and from 200 healthy control subjects. The protocol will consist of two phases. The first one will aim at elaborating the predictive model by detecting (clinical, anthropometric at birth, environmental, lifestyle, social context, emotional state, and mental abilities) in order to develop a model predictive of the events considered: (1) re-hospitalisation; (2) severity and progression of the disease; (3) adherence to therapy; (4) HRQoL; (5) obesity and metabolic syndrome; (6) illness-stress related; (7) school drop-out; (8) school performance. The second one will address validating the previous predictive model. This model will aim to: (1) understand, prevent, and halt the progression of childhood CD; (2) develop new and improved diagnostic tools; (3) pave the way for innovative treatments and additional therapies to traditional clinical practice; and (4) create truly personalised therapeutic and preventive strategies in various sectors, such as cardiology, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. © 2021 by the authors.

While there is evidence to suggest university students experience high rates of mental health disorders, less is known about the specific impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on student mental health and how they are coping with this stress. To address this gap, we conducted an online study among undergraduate students (n = 366) to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academics, social isolation, and mental health, as well as the extent to which they have been implementing a variety of coping strategies. The pandemic had a more pronounced negative effect on female students' academics, social isolation, stress and mental health compared to male counterparts. Moreover, for females, frequent use of social media as a coping mechanism was associated with greater perceived negative impacts on their academic performance and stress levels, compared to males. However, frequent social media use related to similar negative mental health effects for both males and females. While male and female students both reported using substances to cope, for males the use of cannabis was associated with greater negative impacts on academic outcomes, stress and mental health compared to females. These findings highlight the need for adequate student support services across the post-secondary sector, and point to the importance of gender informed interventions to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. © Copyright © 2021 Prowse, Sherratt, Abizaid, Gabrys, Hellemans, Patterson and McQuaid.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Less attention is given to the role of developmental processes, such as identity formation and purpose, in understanding the types of distress current university students can experience. We fill this void by simultaneously assessing the effectiveness of both psychiatric and developmental variables in predicting how often students feel emotional distress in the form of frequently feeling too anxious, depressed, or overwhelmed to study. Methods: Binary logit models were fitted to online survey data collected from a cross-sectional, nation-wide sample of 1010 Canadian full-time university students aged 18 to 24 (63% female). Results: Our findings confirm that the psychiatric and developmental models both explain variance in academic distress. We also found that a developmental model operationalized using key measures of identity formation and purpose significantly accounted for academic distress, over and above variance explained by psychiatric diagnoses. In other words, not only do many students with a psychiatric diagnosis experience distress linked to problems with identity/purpose that interferes with studying, but so do a considerable proportion of students without any diagnosis. This impact persists after controlling for a host of variables assessing demographic/family background, academic preparation and performance, and a number of factors believed to aggravate emotional distress. Conclusions: Universities can respond to the mental health crisis by approaching some forms of distress as developmental problems associated with identity and purpose. © 2020 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Stress in students may yield a decline in academic performance or an increase of a mental issue, hence making of paramount importance the timely diagnosis of stress. Although there exist mechanisms for inferring stress level, most of them: assume the test subject is in a controlled environment; use uncomfortable or unaffordable sensors; or they are applicable only when the subject is at a particular posture. Moreover, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no method capable of plotting a person’s stress level curve on the fly. In this paper, we propose a method capable of doing so; our method combines a set of one-class-classifiers capable of capturing the user stress level according to four strata (Low, Medium–Low, Medium–High, and High). Throughout our research, we have developed a dataset, called Student Resilience, which contains observation of several test subjects carrying a mobile phone, and wearing a wristband. For each test subject our dataset also contains the output of a collection of tests, especially designed to evaluate mental health and self-perceived stress. We have used the survey output as ground truth for validation purposes. Our method was capable of correctly plotting stress for 87% of the days submitted by the test subjects. Additionally, in a further attempt to validate our method, we have used data mining to determine whether a stress plot is likely to be explained by the unique activities carried out by each test subject for a given day of the week. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

A well-defined assessment approach provides detailed insights into program weaknesses and leads to continuous improvement. Whereas a poor assessment approach does not reflect the underlying weaknesses and may result in a useless effort. Furthermore, each accreditation body may have a different recommended outcome measurement approach. As a result, academic institutions may make adhoc choices just to satisfy accreditation requirements rather than designing a sustainable measurement approach. On the other hand, the magnitude of huge tasks for satisfying multiple accreditation bodies results in fatigue and mental stress for academic staff. ABET is a well-known international program accreditation body, and NCAAA is a local accreditation body for academic programs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In this paper, we have documented that how a sustainable outcome measurement mechanism can be designed to satisfy both ABET and NCAAA requirements. The core contribution of this paper is relevant specifically for academic programs in the Kingdom striving to meet both ABET and NCAAA requirements and is also relevant for all education programs to design an appropriate program assessment approach to ensure a sustainable process to foster better learning among students. © 2021 by the authors.

To distance the practitioner from the often-implied religious or spiritual connotations associated with meditation and prayer, in recent times, mindfulness has been referred to as silent sitting or stilling the mind. Increasingly in recent years, mindfulness has also become the subject matter of a number of studies, which have consistently shown it to be effective in promoting mental well-being and increasing concentration and cognitive performance, particularly when connected to a values-based approach. Studies have also shown the practice of mindfulness is helpful in alleviating many modern psychological aspects of mental and emotional difficulties, including self-esteem issues, anxiety, depression, stress-related problems, and interpersonal issues. A myriad of choices of mindfulness practices exist, but the beauty of all mindfulness practices, particularly silent sitting, is that it is quite easy to tailor different styles depending on the needs of any particular clientele. Neurobiological research suggests that mindfulness practices can actually change brain structure and function and is a useful adjunct to mental health and psychotherapy, while promoting improved learning outcomes. The author is a retired successful secondary teacher and school counsellor with 44 years of teaching practice in science, philosophy, psychology, and religion. This chapter provides an overview of his use of silent sitting (incorporating positive affirmations and cognitive rehearsal), which he has used effectively for the past 36 years in both his teaching and counselling practices. The first section is a brief introduction and examination of what research has to say about the common elements of silent sitting and mindfulness practices, with some reference to the neurological processes that research has identified as being involved. The second section is a historical outline of the practices taught and used by the author with secondary school students in Australia. The third section reflects on the use of silent sitting over the last 36 years of counselling practice in both state and private schools. The chapter provides a number of successfully used practices for the reader to follow, both personally and with secondary or tertiary students. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

Whole countries and cities were isolated, public and private institutions ceased their activities, and the country's higher educational institutions were forced to stop full-time education and switch to distance learning. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare the indicators of the mental state (depression, anxiety) of students during full-time and distance learning. The first study was carried out by us during the full-time study period (February 10-17, 2020, sample size n = 154), and the second study was conducted during the distance learning period (October 19-26, 2020, sample size n = 154). The study evaluated such indicators as satisfaction with academic performance, the severity of depressive symptoms and anxiety. The results obtained indicate that the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety among students was significantly higher during the distance learning period compared to similar indicators obtained during the full-time study period. The results of this study indicate that a sudden shift from one learning regime to another was a causative factor in stressful stress, which led to a high prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety among undergraduate students. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

To date, no Cochrane Review examines the effectiveness of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors. Thus, questions remain regarding the efficacy of mindfulness interventions as a preventative mechanism in this population, which is at high risk for poor mental health. Objectives: To assess the effects of psychological interventions with a primary focus on mindfulness on the mental well-being and academic performance of medical students and junior doctors. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and five other databases (to October 2021) and conducted grey literature searches. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials of mindfulness that involved medical students of any year level and junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We included any psychological intervention with a primary focus on teaching the fundamentals of mindfulness as a preventative intervention. Our primary outcomes were anxiety and depression, and our secondary outcomes included stress, burnout, academic performance, suicidal ideation and quality of life. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane, including Cochrane's risk of bias 2 tool (RoB2). Main results: We included 10 studies involving 731 participants in quantitative analysis. Compared with waiting-list control or no intervention, mindfulness interventions did not result in a substantial difference immediately post-intervention for anxiety (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.09, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.52; P = 0.67, I2= 57%; 4 studies, 255 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Converting the SMD back to the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21-item self-report questionnaire (DASS-21) showed an estimated effect size which is unlikely to be clinically important. Similarly, there was no substantial difference immediately post-intervention for depression (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.31; P = 0.62, I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 250 participants; low-certainty evidence). Converting the SMD back to DASS-21 showed an estimated effect size which is unlikely to be clinically important. No studies reported longer-term assessment of the impact of mindfulness interventions on these outcomes. For the secondary outcomes, the meta-analysis showed a small, substantial difference immediately post-intervention for stress, favouring the mindfulness intervention (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.13; P < 0.05, I2= 33%; 8 studies, 474 participants; low-certainty evidence); however, this difference is unlikely to be clinically important. The meta-analysis found no substantial difference immediately post-intervention for burnout (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.00; P = 0.05, I² = 0%; 3 studies, 91 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The meta-analysis found a small, substantial difference immediately post-intervention for academic performance (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.14; P < 0.05, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 79 participants; very low-certainty evidence); however, this difference is unlikely to be clinically important. Lastly, there was no substantial difference immediately post-intervention for quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.02, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.32; 1 study, 167 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were no data available for three pre-specified outcomes of this review: deliberate self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour. We assessed the certainty of evidence to range from low to very low across all outcomes. Across most outcomes, we most frequently judged the risk of bias as having 'some concerns'. There were no studies with a low risk of bias across all domains. Authors' conclusions: The effectiveness of mindfulness in our target population remains unconfirmed. There have been relatively few studies of mindfulness interventions for junior doctors and medical students. The available studies are small, and we have some concerns about their risk of bias. Thus, there is not much evidence on which to draw conclusions on effects of mindfulness interventions in this population. There was no evidence to determine the effects of mindfulness in the long term. Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We investigated the mental health difficulties (MHDs) faced by adolescent students in four senior high schools in Ghana, their coping strategies and support systems. Methods In this convergent mixed-methods study, quantitative data was obtained using validated strengths and difficulties questionnaire to assess the mental health of 405 adolescents. Qualitative data was collected through in-depth interview with 18 teachers and seven focused group discussions with 35 students. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for MHDs were estimated through ordinal logistic regression in Stata 14.2. Qualitative data was analyzed inductively and deductively using ATLAS.ti 7.1. Results Over half (58.5%) experienced peer (20.5%), emotional (16.3%), conduct (13.3%) and hyperactivity (3.0%) problems, whereas 5.4% exhibited prosocial behaviours. MHDs were associated with females (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.47-3.50), bullying (OR = 1.72, CI: 1.07-2.75), domestic violence (OR = 1.87, CI: 1.10-3.17), substance abuse (OR = 8.14, CI: 1.41-46.8), academic pressure (OR = 2.40, CI: 1.30-4.42) and self-perceived poor school performance (OR = 7.36 CI: 2.83-19.16). Qualitatively, we identified financial challenges, spiritual influences, intimate relationships, bullying, and domestic violence as the main themes attributed to MHDs. Coping strategies included isolation, substance use and spiritual help. The main school-based support system was the guidance and counselling unit, but there were complaints of it been ineffective due to trust and confidentially issues, and non-engagement of qualified counsellors. Conclusions As many triggers of MHDs emanate in schools, we need mental health-friendly school environments where trained psychotherapists head counselling centres. We propose incorporating mental health education into school curricula and generating surveillance data on adolescent's mental health. © 2021 Addy et al.

Evidence suggests that mindfulness can support the mental health and wellbeing of university students. We explored the acceptability and effectiveness of an 8-week instructor-led mindfulness-based course (“Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World”; Williams and Penman, 2011) on improving wellbeing and mental health (self-reported distress), orientation and motivation towards academic goals, and the mechanisms driving these changes. Eighty-six undergraduate and post-graduate students (>18 years) participated. Students engaged well with the course, with 36 (48.0%) completing the whole programme, 52 (69.3%) attending 7 out of 8 sessions, and 71 (94.7%) completing at least half. Significant improvements in wellbeing and mental health were found post-intervention and at 6-week follow-up. Improvements in wellbeing were mediated by mindfulness, self-compassion, and resilience. Improvements in mental health were mediated by improvements in mindfulness and resilience but not self-compassion. Significant improvements in students’ orientation to their academic goal, measured by “commitment” to, “likelihood” of achieving, and feeling more equipped with the “skills and resources” needed, were found at post-intervention and at 6-week follow-up. Whilst exploratory, the results suggest that this mindfulness intervention is acceptable and effective for university students and can support academic study. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, much less attention has been focused on understanding who actually accesses mental health services on post-secondary campuses. Methods: The current study reports on a national survey of 8,248 students attending 41 post-secondary campuses across Canada who have accessed their schools' mental health services. The survey solicited self-reported problems among attendees of campus mental health services. Descriptive statistics (means, frequencies) were utilised to summarise responses to items relating to psychological symptoms, suicidal and self-injurious behaviours, stress, impediments to academic performance, and future mental health help seeking. Results: Respondents reported very high levels of stress, with approximately 95% indicating being overwhelmed (n = 7,863) and exhausted (n = 7,803). More than 80% of respondents conveyed feeling very sad (n = 7,200), overwhelming anxiety (n = 6,892) and very lonely (n = 6,670). One quarter (26.1%; n = 2,146) had considered suicide. The most frequently endorsed impediments to academic performance included stress, anxiety, depression and sleep, with nearly three-quarters (73%; n = 6,018) of respondents indicating that academic work has been traumatic or very difficult to handle. Conclusion: The findings of this survey provide a clearer picture of the types of issues that are brought forth by students who avail themselves of campus mental health services, thus enabling such services to better tailor their offerings to the needs of their clientele. © 2021 British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Data collection was conducted between September 2020 and February 2021 in five countries (Sweden, the USA, Serbia, Morocco, and Vietnam). In total, 5114 high school students (aged 15 to 19 years, 61.8% females) responded to our electronic survey. A substantial proportion of students reported decreased time being outside (41.7%), meeting friends in real life (59.4%), and school performance (30.7%), while reporting increased time to do things they did not have time for before (49.3%) and using social media to stay connected (44.9%). One third of the adolescents increased exercise and felt that they have more control over their life. Only a small proportion of adolescents reported substance use, norm-breaking behaviors, or victimization. The overall COVID-19 impact on adolescent life was gender-specific: we found a stronger negative impact on female students. The results indicated that the majority of adolescents could adapt to the dramatic changes in their environment.

Results were analyzed using a process of narrative synthesis. We identified 26 studies which included 2253 children/adolescents with MS (CAMS) and 1608 caregivers. MS was reported to negatively impact experiences for CAMS in domains such as of school performance, social relationships, mental health, and overall physical functioning. Specifically, fatigue and social support were reported as the most important barriers and facilitators for CAMS, respectively. In terms of caregiver experience, negative impacts were reported on social functioning, mental health, and quality of life. Additionally, lack of awareness concerning MS was one of the biggest challenges reported. Caregivers expressed needs for psychological and social support. This study provides the first evidence regarding the needs and experiences of CAMS and their caregivers.

The primary objectives of the present study are to describe the level of IGD and to examine its correlations with sociodemographic factors and psychological comorbidities among undergraduate students in a Malaysian university. Methods: A total of 411 undergraduate students completed an online questionnaire. They were selected from a random sample of participating university faculties. The online questionnaire contained the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short-Form and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale. Results: The presents study reported that 52.8% of the participants had high IGH. Using hierarchical multiple regression, age (β = -0.09, p < 0.05), gender (β = -0.40, p < 0.001) and stress (β = 0.23, p < 0.05) were statistically significant predictors of IGD. Academic performance, depression and anxiety did not emerge as significant predictors. Conclusion: These findings highlight the risk factors (in particular, stress) of IGD. Further studies on interventions, particular that of preventative strategies, will be needed to combat this emerging public health problem. © 2021 UPM Press.

Tamarkoz, a Sufi meditation, may reduce the impact of stressors to prevent illness among students. Tamarkoz is the art of self-knowledge through concentration and meditation. It is a method of concentration that can be applied to any task. The method is said to discipline the mind, body, and emotions to avoid unintended distractions. Therefore, it can be used in daily life activities, such as studying, eating, driving, de-stressing or in Sufism, seeking self-knowledge. This study was an 18-week quasi-experimental design with pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up assessments in the experimental group, a wait-list control, and a third group that utilized the campus health center’s stress management resources. Participants, university students, had no prior exposure to Tamarkoz, and there were no statistically significant differences among groups on baseline measurements. Using a generalized linear mixed model, significant increases in positive emotions and daily spiritual experiences, and reductions in perceived stress and heart rate were found in the experimental group compared to the other two groups. Tamarkoz seems to show some advantages over the usual stress management resources offered by a student health center.

In nursing education curricula and clinical healthcare settings, smartphones have the potential to augment student learning. Nursing students report significant benefits to smartphone use, which extend beyond learning, to include enhanced communication, clinical decision making and evidence-based practice. Despite these benefits, little is known about the negative impact of smartphones on student learning. Objectives: This integrative review aimed to synthesise findings from published research that referred to the detrimental direct or indirect effect of smartphone usage on nursing students. Design: The integrative review was guided by the five-stage approach as conceptualised by Whittemore and Knafl (2005). Methods: Seven electronic databases were systematically searched in consultation with a university librarian (CINAHL Plus, Ovid Medline ALL, Nursing and Allied Health Database, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and ERIC) using a combination of key search terms and medical subject headings. A total of 646 articles were retrieved, and following removal of duplicates, screening of titles and abstracts, a final 27 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Results: Studies in the review originated from Korea (n = 7), Turkey (n = 6), India (n = 4), Spain (n = 3), USA (n = 2), Spain/Portugal (n = 1), Iran (n = 1), France (n = 1), Canada (n = 1) and Egypt (n = 1). Personal smartphone use was reported to be a distraction within clinical and classroom learning, and considered as uncivil, and compromised professionalism. Frequently, smartphones were used for entertainment (e.g. social networking) rather than professional purposes. The studies identified a concerning level of nomophobia and smartphone addiction among nursing students that caused stress and anxiety, and adversely affected sleep, learning and academic performance. Recommendations were proposed for smartphone policies. Conclusions: Excessive smartphones use among nursing students may adversely affect physical and mental health and potentially impact on student learning within the classroom and clinical environment. Educators should consider the implementation of policies or guidance for the responsible use of smartphones by nursing students whilst in the classroom setting and during clinical placement, to mitigate the potential negative impact on health and academic performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Objective: The present study aims to assess the levels of workplace stress of healthcare staff. Material and Method: The sample was 185 members of healthcare staff working in Children's Hospital “P. & A. Kyriakou,” “Aghia Sofia” General Children's Hospital, and “Ippokrateio” General Hospital of Athens from Januray 2019 until November 2019.The data collection was performed with the use of the Expanded Nursing Stress Scale. The analysis was performed with the use of SPSS-22; t-test and anova were also used. Statistical significance was determined at < 0,05. Results: 87,0% of the sample were women; 11,9% were nursing assistants; 37,8% were vocational nurses; 7,0%, were nurses with an academic education;15,1% were interns; and 28,1% were licensed doctors. 47,9% had a specialty in Pediatric Nursing; 33,1% in Pediatrics; and 15,5% in Internal Medicine. The rating scale average was 3,1±0,5, which translates to “quite” up to “very” stressful. Vocational nurses were found higher in the rating scale (p=0,007), thus, reported higher levels of stress, with those on a high-level management function (p=0,013) and the ones working morning shifts (p=0,015) followed. Conclusion: Stress among health care staff depends on many workplace factors. Efforts in improving working conditions contribute in reducing workplace stress. © 2021, Hellenic Nurses Association.

Self-esteem is one of the most important factors in the process of psychosocial growth and has remarkable effect on thoughts, feelings, values, and goals. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of low self-esteem (LSE) and mental distress among Medical Students of Jimma University. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Jimma University from June to July, 2018. Self-esteem was measured with Rosenberg self-esteem scale. Self-administered Short form with General Health Questionnaire was used to assess presence of mental distress. Result: Out of 422 students enrolled to the study, 279 (66.1%) were male, and 413 (97.9 %) were 18 to 25 years of age. The prevalence of LSE and mental distress were 19.0%, and 19.7 %, respectively. Students who had LSE had 5 times higher risk of having mental distress, AOR= 5.1 (95% CI, 2.9-8.9). Moreover, female students had higher risk of developing mental distress (AOR=1.9, 95% CI, 1.1-3.3). Students who had poor social support were 4.3 times at higher risk of developing LSE, AOR=4.3 (95% CI, 1.9-9.8). Those who reported to have poor academic performance were also more likely to have LSE AOR= 3.7 (95% CI, 1.3-10.0). Conclusion: One in five medical students had LSE and it is strongly associated with metal distress. Female students were at higher risk of mental distress. Preventive, curative and rehabilitative mental health services should be available for medical students with particular attention to those with poor social support. © 2021 Netsanet Workneh Gidi, et al.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Higher stress perceptions along with limited coping resources endanger mental health for a considerable number of students and may ruin their performance. The current study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (10 items), PSS-10, in a sample of 379 female Emeriti students. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in two factors with eigenvalues of 3.88 and 1.19, which explained 60.6% of the variance. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed good model fits of two correlated factors (Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.962, Tucker–Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.950, standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR) = 0.0479, and root mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.067). Internal consistency of the PSS-10 and its positive and negative subscales was acceptable (coefficient α = 0.67, 0.79, and 0.86, respectively). Multigroup analysis revealed that the PSS-10 holds invariance across different groups of age, marital status, and financial status (average monthly expenditure). Convergent and concurrent validity tests signify the importance of considering scores of subscales of the PSS-10 along with its total score. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: A total of 357 international students from 62 countries (236 in the host country and 121 in the home country) completed an online questionnaire survey 2 months after transition to online learning. We studied students' levels of loneliness, life and academic satisfaction, acculturative stress, academic adjustment, performance, loyalty, and perceptions of the online learning experience. Results: The country-of-residence variable had no statistically significant effects on most psychological and academic variables. Significant effects were observed only for two academic variables. Specifically, students who returned to the home country found online communication with other students more contributing to their online learning experience and exhibited higher academic adjustment than students who remained in the host country. This suggests the positive influence of (peer and familial) support on online learning experience from the home country. Furthermore, a significant difference in experiencing acculturative stress occurred for students in quarantine/self-isolation in the host country, which expands prior literature on the disruptive effects of social distancing on students' mental health. Finally, this study confirmed the expected increased levels of loneliness among self-isolating students in both countries, hence extending prior results to the home- and host-country contexts. No relationship between self-isolation and students' life or academic satisfaction was found, which is explained by the specific nature of the learning-from-home experience. © Copyright © 2021 Wilczewski, Gorbaniuk and Giuri.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This work applied the socio-ecological model for health promotion to explore the contextual factors that influence this relationship at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and public policy levels. Methods: Using a qualitative, phenomenological approach, we conducted 38 semi-structured interviews with undergraduate students and on-campus staff who provide services to this population at a post-secondary institution in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Thematic analysis inductively identified overarching themes among participants’ perspectives. Results: Several positive and negative factors were identified at each socio-ecological model level, demonstrating the complex interplay of demographic, psychological, emotional, social, physical, and academic factors impacting students’ academic stress. Conclusions: A lack of communication and knowledge seems to underlie many factors, highlighting the need to strengthen communication strategies to promote awareness, accessibility, and availability of services and programs on campus. Results also pointed to focusing on proactive, resilience-focused, upstream mental health promotion efforts at post-secondary institutions to reduce stress and improve academic success. This knowledge can help Canadian campuses better address students’ needs. © 2021 by the authors.

To explore the psychological wellbeing of domestic and international university students during the COVID-19 pandemic, an online cross-sectional survey recruited 787 university students (18+ years) currently studying at an Australian university. In total, 86.8% reported that COVID-19 had significantly impacted their studies. Overall, 34.7% of students reported a sufficient level of wellbeing, while 33.8% showed low wellbeing and 31.5% very low well-being. Wellbeing was significantly higher in postgraduate students compared with undergraduate students. Future anxiety was significantly greater among undergraduate than postgraduate students. Multivariable regression models showed female gender, low subjective social status, negative overall learning experience or reporting COVID-19 having a huge impact on study, were associated with lower wellbeing in the first few months (May–July) of the pandemic. Supporting the health, well-being, and learning experiences of all students should be of high priority now and post-pandemic.

The strain and pressure have only intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive stress increases the risk of medical and mental health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, which influences academic performance. This paper highlights the importance of mental health via quantitative analysis of graduate and undergraduate students from various STEM majors, focusing on space sciences and engineering, and emphasizes the need to prioritize mental health. The study used an online survey, which employed the DASS-21 scale to assess the severity of perceived depression, anxiety, and stress levels of students in the space sector. A self-developed questionnaire by the researchers was used to check the causes for it and get feedback on the effectiveness of present mental health support systems provided by educational institutions, and the data were analyzed through SPSS software. The final sample consisted of 224 undergraduate and graduate-level students of the space sector - studying space sciences, space engineering, or another science or engineering degree with a project, internship, or work related to the space sector. Students from various parts of the world, such as the USA, India, UK, France, Germany, Mexico, Russia, etc. participated in this study. The results of this study indicated that out of the 224 participants, 25.4% showed severe to extremely severe signs of stress, 31.3% showed severe to extremely severe signs of anxiety and 34.9% showed severe to extremely severe signs of depression. The top 3 concerns for stress were reported as academics, the ongoing pandemic, and jobs and about 46% of the participants rated their university's mental health-related support facilities as poor to very poor. There was a non-significant difference found in the stress, anxiety, and depression levels of students with different gender identities and different geographical locations. The results of this research highlight the importance of mental health & stress management classes for students and suggest that a regular evaluation of students' mental health to monitor their well-being is very crucial to help them cope up with stress and anxiety. This research stresses the need for better facilities for mental well-being by educational institutions. Copyright © 2021 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Given that previous studies overlook the mediation of stress perception, the current study expanded previous goal orientation researches by addressing an unexplored mechanism. This study aims to examine the mediational roles of stress perception (perceived stressors and stress-related cognition) on the relationship between achievement goal orientation and depression in medical students. A total of 1,015 Chinese 2-year medical students completed a multi-section questionnaire. Hypotheses were examined by structural equation modeling. The findings suggest that performance-avoidance goal orientation and perceived stressors both demonstrated direct facilitative effects on depression, whereas stress-related cognition demonstrated direct obstructive effects on depression. Both perceived stressors and stress-related cognition mediated the relationship between achievement goal orientation and depression. The findings spark a new perspective on motivational intervention that assist students in adopting mastery-approaching strategy as well as ways of coping with stressful academic situations. Identifying students with achievement goal orientation and providing them with the appropriate supportive services may help them to manage stress and mitigate or prevent depression. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Liu, Ding, Li and Wen.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

While e-learning has an advantage for students that they can attend to their courses from anywhere at their convenience, yet the sudden disruptive shift to e-learning during the pandemic saw students facing many challenges, which had strong ability to induce mental health issues among the students. This study aimed at examining the impact of COVID-19-induced e-learning on the university students’ stress perceptions in Oman. Results: A total of 966 usable responses were received. The results showed that 96.9% (moderate stress = 82.5% and high stress = 14.4%) reported having experienced stress through e-learning during COVID-19. The results further indicated that there was a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and the students’ academic performance. The family support and institutional support were observed to have a significant effect on students’ stress perception. Conclusions: Students are away from the physical campuses over a year now, continuing their courses and programs online. The numerous challenges they are facing through e-learning, together with the prevailing uncertainty, have intensified stress among them. The continued stress over time will not only affect their academic performance, but their mental and physical health as well, as the stress has proven to be one of the major causes of various physical and mental disorders. While e-learning seems to emerge as a new normal, the students require proper attention, help, and support from their families and institutions. The institutions should revisit their online courses and program delivery mechanisms, methods, and practices to ensure that students are not over stressed. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: This crosssectional study collected data from a convenience sample of 1533 adolescents in an eastern province in China. Surveys were used to collect data on academic stress, anxiety, depression, sleep, physical activity, and demographics. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and path analysis were used to analyze data. Results: The participants reported about 6.77 ± 0.89 h of sleep per day and 1.62 ± 1.79 days of 60 min of physical activity each week. Academic stress was positively correlated with anxiety and depression, which were negatively correlated with physical activity and sleep. The path analysis showed that academic stress directly predicted anxiety (β = 0.54) and depression (β = 0.55), and hours of sleep (β = 0.024) and the number of days of 60 min physical activity (β = 0.014) mediated the relation. Conclusion: The results largely supported our hypotheses and supported the need to lessen academic stress experienced by Chinese adolescents, in effort to enhance mental health indices directly, and by allowing for engagement in health-related behaviors such as physical activity and sleep. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: A cross-sectional study between March to June 2019. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire including sociodemographic, academic, family and behavioral issues. The Beck Anxiety Inventory was used to assess anxiety. Estimates were obtained through the prevalence ratio and Poisson multivariate analysis. Results: Four hundred and ninety-three students participated with a mean age of 23.1 and predominantly women (79.9%). All students had some degree of anxiety, with the frequency of the severe, moderate and mild forms being 28.0%, 29.8% and 27.0%, respectively. The factors associated with anxiety included having suffered psychological and/or physical violence in childhood, having suicidal thoughts, having a deceased parent, living with parents, being dissatisfied with the course and being in the exam period. Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety was high in our study and family problems prior to entering university seem to significantly influence the degree of anxiety, which may compromise the student’s academic and social performance. © 2021, Editora Cientifica Nacional Ltda.

Various studies show that the stressful life of medical students can attribute to development of various ailments and deterioration of quality of life. The World Health Organization has defined quality of life as 'individuals' perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and their relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. Aim: To determine the health related quality of life of medical students and assess their mental status. Material and Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College.A total of 235 students from 2nd year MBBS and Final year part 1 MBBS participated in the survey. The study was conducted after obtaining written consent from the participants and permission from the Head of the Department to conduct the study. Results: The students who participated ranged from the age group of 17 years to 24 years, maximum being 21 years (30%), 164 of them were females. Sixty two percent of the students belonged to 2nd year. According to Beck's Depression Inventory, 23%(53) evaluated to have mild mood disturbances. Overall scores for all 8 domains ranged between 78.2 and 60.2. The maximum score was obtained in the Physical Function domain and the minimum score was obtained in the Role Limitation Due to Emotional Problems domain. Conclusions: The study shows that the quality of life, health related as perceived by the participants is low. Various factors may be associated with this, including time constraints for social activities, heavy workload and limited contact with family and friends. Deteriorated quality of life may affect the attainment of knowledge by the students, their performances as well as their future competencies as a clinician. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

However, many do not and it remains an open question whether these programs should be mandatory. We implemented a RCT to examine the effectiveness of assigning medical students to a wellness intervention on adherence to engagement in the assigned intervention and on psychological and academic outcomes. Method: Medical students participated in a 12-week randomized controlled intervention involving one-hour wellness sessions of either (1) yoga; (2) mindfulness; or (3) walking, held twice-weekly. Students completed standardized psychological assessments at baseline and following the intervention. Results: Students randomized to the wellness intervention group engaged in more minutes of assigned activities than students randomized to the control. There was a significant difference in the change from pre- to post- intervention on measures of state anxiety and perceived stress, with better outcomes for the intervention group. Conclusions: The assignment of twice-weekly wellness intervention sessions protects medical students from state anxiety and perceived stress with no negative impact on academic performance. Students adhered to the sessions and reported enjoying the sessions once trying them. Actual engagement is more important than wellness activity type. © 2021 The Author(s).

Relevant research is lacking on positive mental health in medical students, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Sri Lankan students enrolled in a five-year medical program. Measures included the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, and Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. We investigated relationships between year in program, mental health indicators, and academic performance. Three hundred twenty-seven students participated (35% response rate). Most students had moderate positive mental health (64.8%) and severe psychological distress (40.4%). Final year students reported more psychological distress and burnout than first year students. Female students had higher burnout scores than males. In multivariable models, fourth and fifth year students evidenced lower positive mental health than first year students. Mental health indicators were unassociated with academic performance. Overall, distress rates were higher than those reported among students in other countries. Higher burnout and distress may be driven by increased responsibilities in the final clinical years of training. Bolstering positive mental health through positive emotions, meaning, and social connection may minimize burnout and distress, although extracurricular activities require time.

The current study aimed to explore the coevolution of sociometric popularity and depressive symptoms among adolescents suffering from the stress attached to the Chinese gaokao. Methods: The analytical sample comprised 1062 Chinese adolescents who were under significant pressure to return to school for an additional year (returnees) to prepare for college entrance examinations. Students were assessed for depressive symptoms and asked to nominate up to five friends within their classes across four waves (six months). We employed stochastic actororiented models to investigate the interdependent relationships between popularity and depressive symptoms. Results: Adolescents’ depressive symptoms negatively predicted future friendship popularity in this stressful situation, but not vice versa. The results of this study also highlighted the importance of friends’ popularity, indicating that adolescents who nominated popular peers as friends tended to subsequently have lower depressive symptoms. Conclusion: These findings suggested that friends’ popularity may serve as a protective factor against depressive symptoms under major chronic stress. Network-based interventions may have practical implications for reducing depressive symptoms under major chronic stress. © 2021 by the authors.

The necessary strategy of isolation to avoid contagion led to an increase in psychosocial risks in children, adolescents and their families, such as negative coping with stress, negligent parenting practices, domestic violence, substance abuse, among others. Objective: To determine school stress in students during COVID-19 quarantine. Methods: The research was developed under a quantitative approach; cross-sectional, observational, analytical. A total of 1395 adolescents participated. For data collection, a Google form was used to determine school stress, based on an instrument validated in Colombia. Results: Among the most frequent mental health diagnoses, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was found, followed by anxiety disorder and depression. Ninety-two percent of the participants reported concern about their academic performance, likewise 60.2% reported feeling nervous when talking to their parents about their school performance and 62.5% reported feeling nervous about not understanding what was explained in class. Conclusions: It was found that a large part of the participants showed symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress due to the uncertainty of the pandemic.

Unaddressed burnout in medical training may persist in the internship phase and impact the quality of patient care. While some associations have been established, the link between some individual factors and training characteristics with distress and burnout in medical training remained unclear. In this study, we aim to examine the prevalence of psychological distress and burnout, and its association with gender, training phase, funding status, cumulative grade points average (CGPA), and coping strategies among medical students. The study applied a multicenter cross-sectional study design and convenience sampling on medical students from two medical schools from Malaysia and India. We used a self-reporting instrument that includes demographic details, the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief COPE). A total of 748 medical students participated in the study. The prevalence of psychological distress, personal-related, work-related, and patient-related burnout were 33.0%, 56.1%, 35.0%, and 26.2%, respectively. Being male, clinical year, self-funded, and having a CGPA of more than 3.50 predicted psychological distress and burnout with mixed results. Maladaptive coping mechanisms consistently predicted the risk of psychological distress and burnout by more than two times. The findings indicate that primary and secondary mental health interventions have a role in medical training. A systematic intervention should incorporate coping skills training alongside institutional-targeted intervention. © 2021 by the authors.

This research aimed to examine the relationship of forms of anxiety (anticipatory anxiety, school-based performance anxiety, and generalized anxiety) with sources (teacher interac-tions, academic stress, peer interactions, and academic self-concept) and manifestations (emotional, behavioral, and physiological) of school-based distress. Specifically, our objectives were to examine the correlations between anxiety and school-based distress and, using a person-centered approach, to verify whether different anxiety profiles differed in their levels of distress. The Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety-Revised (VAA-R) and the School Situation Survey (SSS) were administered to 756 Spanish students (Mage = 9.6, SD = 1.12); 50.3% were girls. Pearson’s correlation coefficients revealed a positive and significant association between each form of anxiety and each source and manifestation of distress. The latent profile analysis identified three anxiety profiles: High Anxiety, High School-based performance Anxiety, and Low Anxiety. The High Anxiety profile scored significantly higher in all sources and manifestations of distress than the Low Anxiety profile. The High Anxiety profile showed significantly higher scores in peer interactions and emotional and behavioral manifestations of distress than the group High School-based performance Anxiety.

Methods: The sample consisted of 4816 children, who were 3rd, 5th, and 7th graders from schools randomly chosen based on the urbanization level in a recent national survey of childhood mental disorders. Among the 4816 children (2520 boys, 52.3%) interviewed using the Kiddie epidemiologic version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-E) for the DSM-5, 30 children were diagnosed as DMDD (23 boys, 76.7%). They and their parents also reported on the Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents (SAICA). We conducted regressions for survey data that controlled for stratification and clustering. Results: The weighted prevalence of DMDD was 0.3~0.76% in Taiwanese children. Lower parental educational levels, male predominance, higher psychiatric comorbidities, and worse self-report school functions (e.g., more behavioral problems with peers) were observed in children with DMDD than those without. Additional analyses revealed that oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) but not DMDD was related to conduct disorder. Children with ODD with or without DMDD had more problems regarding attitudes toward school, academic performance, and parent-child interaction at home than those with DMDD-only. Limitations: Small sample size of DMDD. Conclusions: DMDD is a rare disorder in the community. Children with DMDD had more psychiatric comorbidities, and subjectively experienced more difficulties than those without. DMDD and ODD both resulted in severe impairment yet in different domains. © 2020","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The impact of call burden on career satisfaction and burnout in neurointerventionalists has not been explored. Methods: A qualitative approach was chosen to obtain rich, detailed accounts of physician experiences. From July 2018 to July 2019, we conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews (mean duration, 43 minutes) with 16 academic neurointerventionalists from various institutions in the United States. Participants were chosen from the Society of Neurointerventional Surgery to include multiple specialties, career stages, and geographic locations. Key themes/subthemes were organized into a conceptual model and shown by exemplary quotes. Results: Participants report a diverse range of previously uncharacterized ways in which stroke call responsibilities affect their lives. Unrealistic performance expectations, discipline-based inequalities, poor organizational workflow, limited opportunities for growth and advancement, and lack of control over call conditions are some of the key themes identified. Participants describe a need for interventions that address both the issues of workload stress (i.e., resources for stroke call and administrative work) and their ability to accomplish professional goals (i.e., flexible work arrangements, leadership autonomy support, and organizational value congruence). Conclusions: The burden of stroke call has strong implications for career satisfaction and burnout in neurointerventionalists. This model can be used by hospitals, departments, and physician groups to better conceptualize conditions that facilitate burnout and attrition. Changes to hospital management practices and culture may be the most productive focal areas for intervention. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This paper aims to describe the correlation between certain parameters of mental health and their manifestation in female students with different sports performance levels. The components of mental health were assessed with a 10-point self-assessment test. The correlation structure was analyzed with respect to the level of statistical significance and correlation sign and depending on the parameters of mental health that affected athletic performance in female students. The data obtained were divided into five groups of factors. The first group of factors includes the ability to create a positive emotional field in the group, self-confidence, everyday well-being and adaptation to different irritants. The second group contains the factors associated with dysfunction such as the presence of mental disorders/illness, symptoms of chronic fatigue, increased heart rate when doing important tasks, disorders of the autonomic nervous system, use of sedative drugs, and wasting too much energy in ordinary tasks. The third group includes female students with a high level of athletic performance, who demonstrated significant correlations for the following parameters of mental health: mental health level, knowledge of stress resistance techniques, mental health awareness, psychological climate in a group, academic, sports, and work-related activities. The fourth group includes female students with a high level of athletic performance, who demonstrated negative correlations with certain mental health parameters. It was revealed that the higher the level of athletic performance, the less its dependence on external environment and other people. The fifth group includes parameters that do not have significant correlations with mental health and athletic performance in both groups of female students. These parameters include the need for psychological support from other people and releasing stress through smoking and alcohol consumption. The inverse correlation between athletic performance and mental health is significant in the group of female students with low athletic performance, which characterizes the activity of the autonomic nervous system. © 2021, Editura Universitatii din Pitesti.

Nursing graduate students often experience stress leading to physical and mental health problems that negatively affect their academic performance and persistence during graduate programs. The purpose of this study was to test multiple mediation effects of sense of coherence (SOC) and social support in the relationship between stress and health status of nursing graduate students. Methods: The participants of this study were 231 female nursing graduate students from 14 universities. Data were collected using an online survey conducted between August and October 2019. Bootstrap techniques using the PROCESS macro for SPSS software were applied to assess the multi-mediating effects. Results: The total effect (B = − 12.29, p <.001) and direct effect (B = − 7.07, p <.001) of perceived stress on health status were significant. Perceived stress had negative direct effects on social support (B = − 0.41, p <.001) and SOC (B = − 5.77, p <.001). SOC had a positive direct effect on health status (B = 0.59, p <.001). However, social support was not a significant predictor of health status (B = 1.24, p = .232). In addition, there was a positive direct effect of social support on SOC (B = 5.23, p <.001). Furthermore, the indirect effect of perceived stress on health status through SOC was significant (B = − 3.42, 95% CI = − 5.2616, − 1.8906). There was also a significant indirect effect of perceived stress on health status through social support and SOC (B = − 1.28, 95% CI = − 2.1663, − 0.5992). Conclusion: It is necessary to create strategies that enhance nursing graduate students’ SOC and social support to reduce their perceived stress and to improve their health status. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The association between IA and unfavorable emotional conditions (e.g., anxiety, stress, and depression) can harm students' relationships and academic and career performance. The present study evaluated (a) the prevalence of IA in a sample of medical sciences university students; (b) the association between IA and depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disorders; and (c) the association between demographic characteristics and IA, depression, anxiety, and stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 268 students from Abadan University of Medical Sciences were selected using Morgan Table. The participants responded to the Young Internet Addiction Test, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-42, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, and least significant difference. RESULTS: The mean score of IA was 45.65 ± 35.40. IA was found to be significantly related to depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disorders (except for sleep disturbance) (P < 0.001). Males were found to be more likely than females to suffer from IA, depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disorders. Furthermore, age was inversely related to IA, depression, and stress. Finally, medical sciences students suffered from depression, anxiety, and stress more than students majoring in other fields. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous occurrence of IA and depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disorders in students indicates that IA is associated with other psychological problems. Therefore, researchers and policymakers need to identify preventive measures to help internet-addicted students.  © 2021 Journal of Education and Health Promotion | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The aim of this study is to assess the magnitude and associated factors of perceived stress and its consequences among undergraduate students at Salale University, Ethiopia. A self-administered cross-sectional study has been conducted among 421 students of Salale University from April 1st to May 30th, 2018. Multiple linear regressions and Spearman’s rank correlation were applied. The overall response rate is 95.49 %. The mean perceived stress score (PSS-14) was 29.97 (standard deviation =7.48). Spearman correlation test has shown that perceived stress is significantly but negatively correlated with grade point average [rs = -0.25 (-0.334–-0.153)] and year of studies [rs = -0.13 (-0.232–-0.032)]. Increased perceived stress indices are significantly associated with female gender (P < 0.001), grade point average (P < 0.01), academic stressors (P < 0.01), and psychosocial stressors (P < 0.01). Mean of PSS-14 was high among health science students (31.42 ± 9.37) than agricultural (30.78 ± 7.69) and business students (28.04 ± 5.43), however, there were no statistically significant differences.

Health maintenance in university students is one of the most relevant and most important topics at every stage of social development. The place of students in the social system, a certain atmosphere of educational activity and a students’ lifestyle in general distinguish this social group from the rest of the population and make it vulnerable to the influence of negative social factors. As a result, efforts aimed at preserving and improving students’ health do not provide long lasting success and increase the relevance of finding new innovative ways to health management in university students. The purpose of the study was to assess the psychophysiological potential and health level of Russian and foreign students. The study was conducted during the 2018-2020 academic year at the South Ural State University. A questionnaire survey was used to obtain information about socio-demographic status, lifestyle and everyday life of university students. The following control tests were used for the assessment of their physical fitness: 1000 m run, 100 m run, standing long jump. The study showed that good academic performance was accompanied by psychophysiological stress. High anxiety was expressed in the internal and external motivation for study. With functional activation of the body, anxiety played a positive role as a mobilizer of mental reserves. The educational system should support students and improve their health status, which affect both motivation for study and academic success in university students. © JPES.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

It may be due to exposure to various stressors. Objectives: To establish the prevalence and factors associated with high perceived stress among university undergraduates in south-western Saudi Arabia. A self-administered survey was conducted among a representative sample of King Khalid University students through a crosssectional study. Data obtained included socio-economic, academic characteristics, and grade point average (GPA) scores. Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. This study included 2467 students. The average Perceived Stress Scale score was 19.13±6.56, which was notably higher (P=.02) among health care undergraduates (19.45±6.49) compared to others (18.85±6.61). High perceived stress prevalence rate was 12.7% (13.6% in health care institutions and 12.0% in non-healthcare institutions). Multivariable analysis revealed that high perceived stress was considerably greater among females (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.35, 95% confidence interval:167-3.30), smokers (aOR=1.65), those with an unsatisfactory income (aOR=3.10), and healthcare students (aOR=1.33). In contrast, it was negatively associated with the GPA score (aOR= 0.77). High perceived stress is a substantial problem among university students. Female students and healthcare students are at a greater risk. High stress is correlated with smoking, lower GPA scores, and perceived insufficient family income. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Here, we investigate three different ways of measuring technology use-total hours of media consumed, hours of video game play and number of media used concurrently-in 118 eight-to-twelve year-old children. At stake is the question of whether different technology uses have different effects, which could explain some of the past mixed findings. We collected data about children's media uses as well as (i) attentional and behavioral control abilities, (ii) psychological distress, psychosocial functioning, and sleep, and (iii) academic achievement and motivation. While attentional control abilities were assessed using both cognitive tests and questionnaires, mental health and sleep were all questionnaire-based. Finally, academic performance was based on self-reported grades, with motivational variables being measured through the grit and the growth-mindset questionnaires. We present partial correlation analyses and construct a psychological network to assess the structural associations between different forms of media consumption and the three categories of measures. We observe that children consume large amounts of media and media multitask substantially. Partial correlation analyses show that media multitasking specifically was mostly correlated with negative mental health, while playing video games was associated with faster responding and better mental health. No significant partial correlations were observed for total hours on media. Psychological network analysis complement these first results by indicating that all three ways of consuming technology are only indirectly related to self-reported grades. Thus, technology uses appear to only indirectly relate to academic performance, while more directly affecting mental health. This work emphasizes the need to differentiate among technology uses if one is to understand how every day digital consumption impacts human behavior. © 2021 Cardoso-Leite et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Neurofeedback is a technique to train the brain in self-regulation skills. We aimed to assess the impact of neurofeedback on the cognitive workload and personal growth areas of surgery residents with burnout and depression. Study Design: Fifteen surgical residents with burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory [MBI] score > 27) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire–9 Depression Screen [PHQ-9] score >10), from 1 academic institution, were enrolled and participated in this institutional review board-approved prospective study. Ten residents with more severe burnout and depression scores were assigned to receive 8 weeks of neurofeedback treatments, and 5 others with less severe symptoms were treated as controls. Each participant's cognitive workload (or mental effort) was assessed initially, and again after treatment via electroencephalogram (EEG) while the subjects performed n-back working memory tasks. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested for significance between the degree of change in the treatment and control groups. Each subject was also asked to rate changes in growth areas, such as sleep and stress. Results: Both groups showed high cognitive workload in the pre-assessment. After the neurofeedback intervention, the treatment group showed a significant (p < 0.01) improvement in cognitive workload via EEG during the working memory task. These differences were not noted in the control group. There was significant correlation between time (NFB sessions) and average improvement in all growth areas (r = 0.98) Conclusions: Residents demonstrated high levels of burnout, correlating with EEG patterns indicative of post-traumatic stress disorder. There was a notable change in cognitive workload after the neurofeedback treatment, suggesting a return to a more efficient neural network. © 2020","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

The education sector has suffered from the pandemic, and university students find them selves in an unprecedented situation. Many univer sity students in Bangladesh require psychological intervention due to adverse mental health conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sec tional study was conducted to evaluate the psycho logical conditions among public university students in Bangladesh during university campus closures necessitated by the pandemic. It also sought to ascertain factors associated with adverse psycho logical conditions during this period. Convenience and snowball sampling techniques were employed. In all, 1,382 university students participated in an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Relationships between student demographic factors and DASS 21 subscales were determined using linear regression models. Students were classified as suffer ing from anxiety (26.85 percent), normal depression (25.47 percent), moderate depression (29.52 per cent), or extremely severe depression (17.73 percent). Students who lived with their families reported less adverse mental health. Factors strongly associated with students' psychological conditions include age, academic field, university year, perception of their own mental health condition during the COVID-19 pandemic, safety concerns about their living place relative to COVID-19, perceptions about social life, academic profile, academic performance, concerns about pandemic impact on their studies, and part-time jobs during the pandemic. Outcomes of this research may assist social organizations and health workers to identify psychologically vulnerable uni-versity students in order to support them more effec tively. Our findings could also be integrated into comprehensive pandemic control efforts. © 2021 Weston Medical Publishing. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence, as well as the risk factors associated with SAD among a cohort of students pursuing undergraduate degree courses in health sciences. This is part of the strategy in building a healthy nation. A questionnaire containing socio-demographic factors and the short version of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to assess the likelihood of psychological distress. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the risk factors of SAD. In total, 449 students completed the questionnaire (93.9% response rate). Of these, 65% had stress, 85.1% had anxiety and 51.4% had depression. Most cases of stress (74.6%) and depression (66.2%) were of normal-to-mild level, while 74.6% of them showed moderate-to-extremely severe anxiety. There was a statistically significant association between stress score and the year of study. In the regression analysis, poor sleep quality and fatigue were risk factors of anxiety and depression, whereas low-grade fever and frequent headaches were risk factors for stress and anxiety. Stress, anxiety, and depression scores were significantly higher among students studying medical imaging. A substantial proportion of health science students are suffering from SAD. This study recommends screening and close monitoring of the above-mentioned predictors and the formulation of comprehensive intervention strategies for students with SAD. © 2021 by the authors.

COVID-19 has robbed the lifestyle of being a university student and transformed the learning system into online. However, from the perspective of digitalization, it’s an achievement but a sudden change has stirred many conflicts on the mental health of students in terms of accepting drastic movement taken by the university due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Academic performance of students is in limbo as they tend to avoiding registered for subjects due to lack of absorbance of changes in the mode of learning with limited facilities to support them along the way. In response, it gives monumental pressure to grasp the subjects via online where it can affect the academic performance of students. This study investigated the state of mind of students who are undergoing classes via online. As such, mental state, physical and ergonomic factors associating with academic background among students will be the focus of this study. Data had been collected from a private university in Malaysia by using online platform. We used non-parametric clustering technique K-medoids based on unsupervised approach and Davies-Bouldin Index to measure cluster quality. Though in the past a few researchers have investigated similar studies, there is no research work reported using the clustering technique to study the aforementioned factors. A total of 8 distinct clusters were obtained. The patterns in the clusters indicated that high mental stress, poor ergonomic settings, alongside high potential risk of injuries were present in students in the clusters regardless of academic background. In particular, the two groups of clusters namely C4, C5, C6, C7 and C1, C2 need immediate attention in respect of mental, health and pedagogy support. As of result, the management of university, family members and university stakeholders should play their part by providing students with psychological support, comfortable study workspace, appropriate pedagogy support. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Now known to the world as COVID-19, the devastating disease of what has become a pandemic started its spread from Wuhan, China and swiftly engulfed the whole world with almost 11 million cases, in a span of around six months. It has not only increased the global burden of disease but has heavily dented many social institutions, including education. Methods: This study investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures of lockdown, quarantine, and social distancing have affected students. We look specifically into the effects on individuals' mental health, that is, the stress and anxiety levels of college and university students using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Results: Among 494 respondents, 61% were females, and the majority (77.3%) of the students were in the age group of 19-25 years. Among the respondents, 125 (25.3%), 45 (9.1%) and 34 (6.9%) experienced minimal to moderate, severe, and most extreme levels of anxiety, respectively. The variables of gender, age and year of study were significant at the 0.25 level by univariate analyses. Nevertheless, the ordinal regression indicates that only gender was significant. The odds of a female student being more anxious are higher compared to a male student (OR = 1.779, 95% CI [1.202-2.634], P = 0.004). The most prominent stressors attained from the qualitative feedback from the Pakistani students are associated with online teaching, concerns about their academic performance and completion of the current semester, uncertainty related to exam dates, and the status of the following semester. Conclusions: This study will add to the existing body of literature on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and psychological health of students. The study outcomes will provide basic data for further applied and action research and a framework for universities and policy makers in Pakistan and the neighboring countries in the region with the same cultural contexts. Thus, relevant health interventions can be designed for better mental health and educational attainments of students from higher educational institutions. This pathological pandemic may well lead to another pandemic of mental and behavioral illness. All stakeholders should join force regardless of pre-existing differences and inequalities to ensure the well-being of future generations, specifically students from higher educational institutions. The long-lasting impacts and the aftermath of this pandemic will unquestionably need further and future investigations.

Gifted students may experience more stress, anxiety, and adjustment problems than non-gifted students due to several reasons. This study investigated the prevalence of stress, coping strategies, and their association in high school gifted students. A cross-sectional study among 535 students from Le Hong Phong high school for the gifted was conducted. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire containing questions about background information, the Perceived Stress Scale to assess stress perception, and the Coping Strategies Inventory to evaluate coping strategies. Among 500 completed questionnaires included in the analysis, the prevalence of perceived stress was 28.4%, including 21.4% moderate stress and 7.0% severe stress. Problem solving was the most preferred strategy (2.6 ± 0.6), followed by wishful thinking (2.5 ± 0.9) and cognitive restructuring (2.4 ± 0.7). Students who had higher level of stress, experienced excessive parental control or parental aspiration for their academic performance were more likely to have disengagement strategies such as wishful thinking, social withdrawal, and self-criticism. In contrast, higher likelihood of having engagement coping strategies was found in students who had good relationship with teachers and peers and those who joined extracurricular activities. In overall, the prevalence of perceived stress in Vietnamese high school gifted students was high, but not all students chose proper stress coping strategies.

One notable aspect deserving emphasis however, is the psychological impact in children as a result of the purported surge of domestic violence (DV) in many of the countries that imposed stay-at-home requirement. The imposition of movement restriction policy led to isolation and overcrowding, made worse by loss of income in some instances, causing high levels of stress and anxiety, thereby increasing the risk of DV and child abuse particularly those already living within violent or dysfunctional families. Children exposed to DV have higher risk of developmental delay and behavioural problems, more likely to suffer from post-traumatic symptoms, depression and anxiety, reduced cognitive functioning and social competence. Additionally, these children tend to have poorer academic performance and are more likely to engage in violent or abusive relationship later in life.

In these phases, late or insufficient treatment of diseases may lead to chronification and favor development of additional disorders. In adolescents, migraine often has a highly negative impact on school performance and everyday life. The hypothesis of the present study was that adolescents with migraine have a higher risk for developing additional disorders such as psychiatric disorders or other pain syndromes in the course of the disease. Materials and methods: In this study, we analyzed health insurance data of 56,597 German adolescents at the age of 15 years in the year 2006. By using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10), we determined a group with migraine diagnosis in the year 2006 and a control group without any headache diagnosis in 2006. We then compared both groups regarding the development of additional disorders (based on the ICD 10) during the following 10 years (2007 to 2016). Results: Adolescents with migraine had a 2.1 fold higher risk than persons without migraine diagnosis to develop an additional affective or mood disorder, a 1.8 fold higher risk to obtain neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, a 1.8 fold higher risk to subsequently suffer from behavioral syndromes, a 1.6 higher risk to get back pain and a 1.5 fold higher risk for irritable bowel syndrome during the next 10 years. Conclusion: Adolescents with migraine are at risk for developing additional disorders later. Considering and addressing the patient’s risks and potential medical and psychosocial problems might improve the long-term outcome significantly. © International Headache Society 2021.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Indeed, the pandemic has had a considerable impact on the delivery of medical education in the UK for both pre-clinical and clinical year students. In response to the escalating case fatality rate due to the pandemic, there has been widespread termination of clinical placements, face-to-face teaching sessions, and examinations that require a physical presence by UK medical schools. It is hoped that the cancellation of the aforementioned activities will greatly reduce the exposure of medical students to the coronavirus however, the consequences of these actions may pose substantial issues for the learning experience and professional development of medical students. One such issue is the lack of regular communication between students and personal tutors which may give rise to burnout within students and impede academic performance. Furthermore, the suspension of clinical placements may result in a gradual reduction in students’ clinical skills competence. The practice of medicine is grounded upon the application of basic science which involves undertaking clinical procedures and as such, students may be at a disadvantage due to the missed opportunity to refine these essential skills. In this article, we provide an overview of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical education, specifically regarding curriculum delivery and assessment of students. We also adopt a holistic approach by considering the impact of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of medical students during this unprecedented time. We offer pragmatic suggestions to uphold the quality of medical education such as the implementation of virtual interprofessional education sessions to solve clinical vignettes and virtual consultation skills with simulated patients. We conclude with suggested areas for future research to examine the effectiveness of a virtual interprofessional education model on both short and long-term learning as well as encouraging medical students and academic staff to trial innovative methods of teaching. Despite the resultant complications of the pandemic on medical education, these challenging times may present a serendipitous opportunity for medical students to cultivate the personal attributes expected of a doctor in the face of adversity.

The initial sample consisted of 142 articles, of which 42 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in detail. The findings show that the current research is in an exploratory phase, with a greater predominance of descriptive, nonexperimental, and cross-sectional studies that explore the prevalence of nomophobia mainly in adolescents and university students. The most widely used measurement instrument is the Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) proposed by Yildrim and Correia. In addition, the research suggests that nomophobia negatively affects personality, self-esteem, anxiety, stress, academic performance, and other physical and mental health problems.

This could further impact future health professionals’ attitudes and compromise patients’ care. This study aims to find out various sources of stress for medical and dental students to help prevent many future health problems in a student’s life. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study done in Universal College of Medical Sciences, Bhairhawa, Nepal, among undergraduate final year bachelor of medicine and bachelor of surgery and third and fourth year (phase I and phase II) dental students, using a questionnaire with Likert’s scale. Data obtained was tabulated and analyzed using analysis of variance. Results: Results showed that stress during exam 210 (92.9%) and preparation phase 200 (88.5%) stood out as the maximum stressors for our study group. The least stress-causing element was recorded as terms with seniors 45 (19.9%), adjustment with roommates 52 (23.01%), and competing with peers 69 (30.53%). Length of course 187 (82.74%), understanding the course 173 (76.55%), reading several textbooks 171 (75.66%), and work overload 165 (73.01%) amounted to significant stressors. Conclusions: Stress has a detrimental effect both on health as well as academic performance. The stressors at the campus should be identified and proper coping assistance should be provided to individual students. Systemic efforts are needed to address their concerns and make mental health care easily accessible to them.

Although early identification of burnout would prevent its effects on mental health and academic performance, the validation of such instrument in French adapted to the specificities of PhD students still had to be established. Materiel and methods This study proposes the validation of a PhD student academic burnout scale (MBI-SS-D) adapted from the French version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS). No less than 1150 PhD students from more than ten courses in France answered the online questionnaire. There were still 862 of them at the retest 6 months later. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factorial analyses at both times irremediably confirmed the three-dimensional structure of burnout (emotional exhaustion, cynicism, academic self-efficacy). The alpha and omega indices close to.80 and the split-half coefficients between.70 and.89 reinforced this observation. In addition, the metric and structural invariance tests proved the high test-retest stability of MBI-SS-D up to the most stringent criterion. Regarding divergent validity, the burnout measure was negatively related to both optimism (Rs = −. 41; P < .001) and resilience (Rs = −. 32; P < .001). Conclusions: The MBI-SS-D shows real psychometric qualities. It is currently the only French-language tool that provides a valid measure of academic burnout for research or clinical practice purposes among PhD students. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

In the absence of teachers’ supportive roles, some susceptible pupils may experience unrecognized sadness, despair, and/or anger. As a result pupils can get low academic performance, and loss of control over their lives. Therefore, teachers must be involved in specific education programs and training sessions about common childhood mental health disorders, especially post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, ensuring that the majority of teachers have benefited from such programs is an important aspect. Objectives: The study objective is to construct and evaluate an education program for elementary school teachers about post-traumatic stress disorder among pupils. Materials and Method: A Quasi-experimental design was carried out through the present study with application of pre and post-tests approach. The study sample consisted of (60) teachers participated voluntarily in the study. Teachers were randomly selected from (60) elementary schools inside Mosul (Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq). The study subjects were divided into two equal groups of (30) teachers, study group which was exposed to the education program, while the control group was not exposed to the education program. Data were analyzed by using SPSS version-25. Results: The results reveal that there are statistically significant differences in teachers’ knowledge regarding all (PTSD) related knowledge domains in comparison between pre and post tests for study group compared with control group. Conclusion: The study concludes that there is a considerable acquisition in teachers’ knowledge regarding post-traumatic stress disorder following program implementation. Recommendations: The study recommends to construct and apply such mental health education programs in most Iraqi governorates elementary schools. © 2020, World Informations Syndicate.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dream-enacting behavior (shouting, punching, and falling out of bed) related to unpleasant dreams and loss of normal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep muscle atonia. Rapid eye movement sleep enhances learning and memory by regulating neuronal synapses, and if it is undesirable, it can lead to cognitive impairment and poor academic performance and may end up with death. To the best of our searching databases, there is no such study conducted in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study is aimed at determining self-reported symptoms of RBD and its associated factors among the University of Gondar medicine and health science students (2019). Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study from June 1 to July 2019, among medicine and health science students at the University of Gondar using a simple random sampling technique. A self-reported RBD screening questionnaire was used to collect the data. We used Epi Info™ 7.0.8.3 and Stata 14 for data entry and statistical analyses, respectively. Descriptive statistics (frequency with percent and mean with standard deviation) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% uncertainty interval (UI) were computed. In a multivariable binary logistic regression, variables with a p<0.05 were declared as significant. Results. Three hundred and eighty-seven students took part in the study. The mean age of participants was 20.81 (±1.83) years. The prevalence of self-reported RBD was 46.25% [95% UI (41.26%-51.24)]. Physical exercise immediately before sleep (AOR=2.50, 95% UI (1.24-5.02)), using Facebook immediately before sleep (AOR=1.93, 95% UI (1.18-3.15)), having daytime sleepiness (AOR=1.92, 95% UI (1.16-3.19)), and self-reported depressive symptoms (AOR=2.40, 95% UI (1.45-3.99)) were significantly associated with self-reported RBD. Conclusion. The current study revealed a high prevalence of self-reported RBD. This remarkable problem suggested a need to design strategies to prevent RBD symptoms among university students through targeting screening of depression, daytime sleepiness, and adjusting bedtime routines such as physical exercise and internet use immediately before going to bed. © 2020 Baye Dagnew et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study aims to describe the HA present in a population of certified nursing assistant students (n = 921) in Spain and then to explore their relationships with the SOC, the motivation to choose healthcare studies and their academic performance. A great variety of HA were identified and mapped. Findings showed that individuals with greater motivation towards self-care and ‘caring for others’ as internal HA, possessed higher SOC levels and a strong vocation for healthcare work. Differences in HA were identified according to gender, age and employment situation. Consistent connections between the care–relation factor and vocational factor with interpersonal and extrapersonal HA were reported. Evidence and results substantiated the salutogenic and asset-based approach as a proper strategy to strengthen SOC, dynamize their HA map, reinforce the sense of calling and enable Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA) students to buffer against caregiving-related stress and thrive in their profession. © 2020 by the authors.

Data for this model has been collected by using structured questionnaires administered to 418 Pakistani university students (undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate) aged between 18 and 36 years old. Structural equation modeling through analysis of moment structures (AMOS) was applied to find that physical activity significantly reduces academic anxiety and self-criticism, and it develops self-enhancement. Further, self-enhancement was negatively associated with academic anxiety while self-criticism is directly related to academic anxiety.

Being able to detect anxiety-related stress levels in a simple and objective way contributes greatly to dealing with low performance and school drop-out by students. Methods: The main contribution of this study is to identify the physiological features that could be used as predictors of stressful activities and states of anxiety in academic environments using an Arduino board and low-cost sensors. A test with 21 students was conducted, and a stress-inducing protocol was proposed and 21 physiological features of five signals were analyzed. In addition, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to assess the level of anxiety for each student. Four classifiers were compared to find the physiological feature subset that provides the best accuracy to identify states of stress and anxiety. Results: The stress due to activities performed by students can be identified with an accuracy greater than 90% (Kappa = 0.84) using the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier, using data from heart rate, skin temperature and oximetry signals and four physiological features. Meanwhile, the identification of anxiety was achieved with an accuracy greater than 95% (Kappa = 0.90) using the SVM classifier with data from the galvanic skin response (GSR) signal and three physiological features. Conclusions: The results provide a clue that anxiety detection in academic environments could be done using the analysis of physiological signals instead of STAI test scores. Besides, the results suggest that physiological features could be used to develop stress recognition systems to help teachers to identify the stressful tasks in an academic environment or to develop anxiety recognition systems to help students to control their level of anxiety when they are performing either academic tasks or exams. © 2020","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, studies on Saudi populations are still in their infancy. Mindfulness is a personal tendency to focus on the present time in a non-judgmental manner, including the interior and exterior experience of feelings and events. The first aim of this study is to examine the relationship between mindfulness, stress, depression, and academic performance in a sample of medical students from King Saud University. The second aim is to explore the potential moderation effects of mindfulness on the impact of stress on academic performance and depression in the study population. This cross-sectional study examined 289 medical students who were selected by a stratified random sampling technique and completed validated online questionnaires measuring mindfulness, stress, and depression. The data were analyzed using SAS version 9.2, and R software was used for graphs. Correlation analysis showed that mindfulness is inversely associated with depression and stress, but not with academic performance. Furthermore, multiple logistic regression showed that mindfulness can predict both depression and stress. We also found that two subscales of mindfulness can moderate the relation between stress and depression: non-judging of inner experience and describing. The findings suggest that a higher mindfulness score is associated with lower depression and stress levels and could buffer against depression in a stressful environment. There is a need for further research to investigate the relation of mindfulness with positive psychological outcomes, as well as experimental trials to examine the efficacy of mindfulness training on improving mental wellbeing in our community. © 2020 Alzahrani et al.

The study of its relationship with salutogenic variables such as social support, positive thinking and psychological well-being could be useful for its intervention, enhance the beneficial function of stress and avoid its adverse effects. Objective: To determine the level of academic stress and its sources in dentistry students, as well as to identify its association with psychological well-being, social support, and positive thinking. Detecting psychological well-be-ing, social support and positive thinking are predictors of stress in this population. Method: Dentistry students completed an online questionnaire survey composed of an identification card and the instruments Academic Stress Questionnaire in the University (CEAU), Positivity Scale (PS), Reduced Scale of Social, Perceived, Family and Friends Support (AFA)-R), and the Psychological Wellness Scale for Adults (BIEPS-A). Results: 146 students participated, 104 women and 42 men. The level of stress, social support and positive thinking was moderate; while the level of psychological well-being was high. Regarding men, women showed greater stress (p < 0.01) and lower psychological well-be-ing (p < 0.05). Stress showed a negative correlation with psychological well-being (r = –0.41) and social support (r = –0.29) but only in women. A multiple lineal regression indicate that psychological well-being (β = –0.27) and female sex (β = –0.26) predicts the stress level (p = 0.01). This model explains 15% of variance (R2 corrected = 0.15). Aspects that generated greater stress were the academic performance and the future perspective of his profession. Conclusions: The identifying healthy predictors of stress in dentistry students favors the well-founded design of intervention strategies that favor the positive development of this population. © 2020, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Negligence of one's mental and emotional health can lead to severe problems such as anxiety, stress, depression, etc. Quick detection and treatment of these problems are essential for the mental health of students. Depression detection in college students is very tough, largely due to the sheer population of students, along with the fact that they may not be aware of their mental problems. Furthermore, because of the stigma surrounding mental health, students may be concealing their psychological issues from everyone. An automatic depression detection system that can predict if students are dealing with depression is required. The proposed system uses video footage of college students to extract the facial features by use of the KLT Algorithm (Face-Detection/Tracking) and Gabor Filters to examine them with an intent to identify symptoms of depression. The final step is to classify the students as having depression or not by utilizing SVM based classifier. The system has been trained with datasets having images of faces along with the classification of whether they are contempt, disgusted, or happy. The level of these emotions in the extracted frames is analyzed to detect depression. © 2020 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Aim: This study aimed to investigate the effects of distraction-focused interventions on examination stress and anxiety in nursing students. Methods: A randomized controlled, parallel trial design was conducted from January to June 2016. After baseline measurement, 72 participants were randomized to one of the following groups (n = 18 each): (i) animal-assisted therapy; (ii) music therapy; (iii) mandala painting; (iv) control group. Outcomes of all groups in terms of stress-reduction were compared by measuring self-reported perceived stress (STAI-State and visual analogue stress scale) and salivary biomarker levels (Cortisol and Immunoglobulin A). Results: Fifty-seven complete data sets (n = 12-16 for each group) were analysed. All distraction-focused interventions showed stress and anxiety reduction in everyday school situations. By contrast, on days with examinations, stress reductions did not reach statistical significance in regard to self-reported psychological stress. At the same time, interventions resulted in significantly decreased levels of stress biomarkers (P <.001).

Material and Method: Cross-sectional, observational, quantitative study, with a correlational scope, carried out in a multicenter sample of 80 first-year nursing students (CI= 90; error= 0.5); emotional intelligence was evaluated with the Trait Meta-Mood Scale Number 24 (TMMS-24), and depressive, anxious and stress symptoms with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale Number 21 (DASS-21). In addition, sociodemographic and academic characteristics were considered as control variables. The descriptive analysis was performed using frequency measures, relative central tendency, Student’s t tests, and for the correlation between dimensions, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was applied. Results: High levels of depression, anxiety and stress were registered. Depressive symptoms and stress correlated with low understanding (p <0.01) and emotional regulation (p <0.001), with the latter also showing moderate correlations with anxiety. The dimensions of emotional intelligence and symptomatology evaluated were sensitive to the presence of poor academic performance (p <0.05) and were also associated with poor sleep quality and little rest time (p <0.05). Conclusion: A greater perception of abilities to regulate and understand emotions is associated with less symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress.

Complexity and unique nature of MMBD increment the application of IoT by using biofeedback sensors. The efforts of present chapter are made to analyze two biofeedback therapies GSR and EMG on various modes like audio, visual and audio-visual mode in the treatment of TTH over a period of 12 months. The physical, mental and total scores of subjects have been analysed on both the therapies of electromyograph and galvanic skin responses in auditory, visibility and combined process. In the present chapter, the author team has made efforts to check the hypothesis and check the efficacy of both biofeedback techniques on possible individual and combined modes. Background and Purpose Nearly 90% of all headaches are subset of tension-type headache (TTH) Rubin (Biofeedback and binocular vision. J Behav Optom 3(4):9598, 1992 [1]). Efficacy of electromyography (EMG) biofeedback (BF) has been extensively studied on tension-type headache and is proved with the help of Big Data. However, insufficient amount of study can be spot on accuracy of galvanic skin resistance (GSR) biofeedback. So far, there are no studies on the accuracy of secluded visual, audio and combined EMG or GSR biofeedback TTH Mullaly et al. (Efficacy of BF in the treatment of migraine and tension type headaches. Pain Physician 12:1005–1011 2009 [2]) and Fumal and Scohnen (Tension-type headache: current research and clinical management Lancet Neurol 7:70–83, 2008 [3]). Stress due to TTH is a very frequent occurrence in all our lives. A TTH symptom experienced for long by an individual with no relief or with increased frequency is termed as “distress”. Acute and chronic stress may affect physiological responses to TTH. Stress-related disorders are called as “psychosomatic” disorders in which body and mind of an individual are involved. Prime negative effect induced in one’s life is the result of events like deaths of close family members, surgery and divorce. In past years, such incidents have been passably related to attribute of headache. Biofeedback therapies include the use of non-pharmacological treatments that utilize scientific instruments to evaluate, amplify and feedback physiological information to the patients being monitored, thereby promoting control and manipulation of physiological parameters. No doubt, everyone will accept the key role or researchers in academic industrialization and “collegialization” of research. There is a vast increment in the research methods in enterprises and industries due to commercialization of academic process and its related organizations. Since, Internet is available in the easy rates to everybody, this facility has its own boons and curses because knowledge of different aspects are available to individual now a days in bigger amount than earlier time. Many tools for the research purposes are being created, cross-checked by validation smart techniques, and academy and industries are in race to get the patents for them so that they can create another mean for moneymaking and business in scientific creations. Many developers are working tirelessly to create the tools as per these company specifications. No doubt the SF-36 score and related questionnaire form are much popular and so the organizations with the trust for medical outcomes, quality metric designing, laboratory for assessing the health standards, incorporation of Optum have prepared the similar policies for usage of SF36 data globally. These corporations provide the license agreements for individual scholars for commercial and research purposes and do evaluation of data, responses consistence and consistency internally, and they also provide for ease the scoring and interpretations of data for the general users and researchers. The SF-36 score can also be published on Internet to enlarge its reach. The data collected can be analysed with the help of Big Data by any organization. Multimedia technology has shifted the approach we gaze at computers. The initial computers were considered as single-purpose machines that could only solve any complex mathematical problem. In 1960, huge corporate database was managed by mainframe computers. It has been observed that the use of devices related to multimedia increased at an exponential rate in all formats—audio, visual or audio-visual). Billion-dollar market is set on the bottom of electronic gadgets. For technocrats, the new challenge is to handle the huge generation of data, which is created per millisecond. This chapter deals with data related to MMBD, like reliability and scalability, accessibility, heterogeneity and quality of services for mental health. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

However, the relationships between extra‐school tutoring time, somatic symptoms, defined as physical symptoms of emotional distress, and sleep duration in adolescents has rarely been determined. The aim of this study was to identify these relationships in adolescent students. Data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey were analyzed to address the research questions. Weekday sleep duration, extra‐school tutoring time, and somatic symptoms were measured using adolescents’ self‐report questionnaires. A multilevel, structural equation model was utilized to test the relationships between these variables and was deemed appropriate considering the repeated measure of the panel data. After controlling for respondent sex, parent working status and education level, and family structure, adolescents’ extra‐school tutoring time and level of somatic symptoms were associated with sleep duration during weekdays. Furthermore, the association between extra‐school tutoring time and sleep duration was partially mediated by somatic symptoms. Korean adolescent students slept less than the recommended duration. Intervention programs that increase parental interest and attention in adolescent students’ lives, not only focused on academic achievement but also emotional distress is needed. Researchers and policymakers should understand recommended age‐appropriate sleep duration and the educational culture and provide balanced strategies between the consideration of the effect of private education on academic achievement and the need to guarantee physical and mental health in adolescent students. © 2020 by the authors.

This decreased cognitive efficiency may result in anxiety, low mood, perceived stress and decreased emotional well-being and quality-of-life. These psychological symptoms may further exacerbate cognitive decline.Exploring non-pharmacological interventions such as mindfulness within primary care is vital in enabling individuals to develop strategies to manage cognitive impairment or psychological symptoms. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an 8-week programme that is beneficial in alleviating psychological symptoms; however, its impact on perceived satisfaction on overall functional performance with this population has not been evaluated. The primary objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial of an occupational therapist-led MBSR programme within primary care. METHODS: Convergent mixed-methods, randomised control feasibility trial with 40 participants from an interprofessional primary care team in Toronto, Ontario. Participants are randomised into the 8-week MBSR group or wait-list control will be compared at baseline, postintervention and 4weeks follow-up. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of the intervention with this population and setting. The secondary aim is to examine perceived satisfaction with functional performance as measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Secondary clinical outcomes include psychological symptoms. ANALYSIS: Investigators will analyse the quantitative and qualitative data strands separately. Descriptive statistics, focus group and interviews will then be merged and further analysed to best understand the feasibility and preliminary clinical outcomes from the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by Women's College Hospital (2017-0056-E), and Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario (6026418).

Mental distress was screened using the self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20). Data was analyzed using Stata version 15.1. Frequencies and percentages were used to summarize categorical variables while mean and standard deviation for numeric variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with mental distress adjusted for potential confounders. Results: A total of 402 undergraduate students participated in this study, 14% screened positive for mental distress. Residing off-campus (OR = 0.44, 95%CI 0.20-0.96) and perceived availability of social support (OR = 0.22, 95%CI 0.11-0.45) reduced the odds of mental distress while students with family history of mental distress (OR = 2.60, 95%CI 1.04-6.57) and those with decreased grades than anticipated (OR = 3.61, 95%CI 1.91-6.83) had higher likelihood of mental distress. Conclusion: One in every ten students screened was positive for mental distress. Those who reported a family history of mental illness and lower grades than anticipated had higher response of mental distress. To relieve students from stress and frustrations related to studies and their lives in general, this study recommends awareness creation, counselling to help those with mental health issues, establishment of student drop-in centers for such services and promotion of social and recreational activities at the college. © 2020 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The aim of this study was to analyze differences in psychophysiological stress markers, behavior and academic performance of rural and city students. A sample of 181 children (7.91 ± 2.29 years) from elementary schools were evaluated on their grades, subjective academic performance, heart rate variability, state anxiety, nutritional information and physical activity habits. Results presented significant higher values in parasympathetic modulation and physical education grades in rural students than in city students, who showed higher significant values in state anxiety, the ability to complete tasks, physical activity habits and several items relating to their food and drink habits. No significant differences were found in the average grades between the two groups. However, some correlations were found between school performance and stress, physical fitness and nutritional habits. Thus, school location may affect the stress and anxiety status, nutritional habits and physical activities of students, but there were no significant differences in academic performance. In addition, body mass index, quantity of food intake and stress markers may be related to the academic performance attained. © 2020 by the authors.

Interestingly, increased resilience and stress-coping abilities have been found in children with divorced parents when encountering adverse events post-divorce. Starting university life represents a significant life change, which can cause stress and affects academic performance. To determine whether experiencing divorce before the age of 18 has an effect on mental health and wellbeing in university students, this novel study explores the resilience, stress-coping ability, personality, self-esteem and empathy, between two groups of students: those who did and those who did not experience parental divorce early in life. 102 undergraduate and postgraduate students completed the Brief Resilience Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Empathy-Quotient Cambridge Scale, and the Big Five Inventory-60. The results revealed no significant differences between respondents with married or divorced parents, suggesting that the experience of divorce does not impact on self-esteem, resilience and stress coping abilities. The results further indicated that the wellbeing of female and male participants is affected differently by divorce. Consequently adapted support has to be provided to children, depending on their gender. © 2020 Slovenian Umbrella Association for Psychotherapy. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This situation could be explained among other reasons due to the difficulties to define and operationalise what good mental health is. The current manuscript, produced by the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Thematic Working Group on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion (ECNP TWG PMD-MHP), presents a critical review of the available operationalizations for good mental health. A pragmatic conceptual operationalisation of good mental health is a much-needed step towards more standardised research in this field. Good mental health can be defined as a state of well-being that allows individuals to cope with the normal stresses of life and function productively. Universal and selective interventions are suitable to promote mental health. Core domains that define good mental health encompass: (i) mental health literacy, (ii) attitude towards mental disorders, (iii) self-perceptions and values, (iv) cognitive skills, (v) academic/ occupational performance, (vi) emotions, (vii) behaviours, (viii) self-management strategies, (ix) social skills, (x) family and significant relationships (xi) physical health, (xii) sexual health, (xiii) meaning of life, (xiv) and quality of life. These domains should be widely traceable in the literature and can be used to conduct further empirical research in the field of good mental health. Such data can lead to more robust evidence to identify and establish the pathways to follow in order to improve mental health. © 2020 The Authors","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Study design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: Overall, 1724 students aged 12-19 yr were selected from 53 high schools in Qazvin City, northwest instead of central Iran through stratified cluster sampling. The sources of academic stress include family conditions, education system, future concerns, academic competitions, interaction with teachers, school disciplines, peer pressure, parental involvement, and financial problems. Academic self-efficacy and self-concept were the mediator constructs. The students and schools´ information were considered on levels 1 and 2, respectively. A Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling (MSEM) analysis was done. Results: High value of academic stress was associated with reduction of mental health. On the student level, the academic stress caused by the families 0.31 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.34), peers 0.29 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.32), and the education system 0.21 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.24) had the highest impact on the adolescentsˊ mental health, respectively. There was a direct and indirect relation between academic stress and mental health through the self-concept. On the school level, only family conditions stress had a relation with mental health (P=0.015, b=1.08). Academic self-efficacy showed no significant relation in the model. Conclusion: The stress from the family is the most important source of stress associated with adolescent mental health. Self-concept unlike academic self-efficacy had an important mediating role in the relation between different sources of academic stress and adolescents' mental health. © 2020 The Author(s);.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study investigated the relationship between measures of resilience and practice education performance in occupational therapy students. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study was used to collect the data. In all, 149 occupational therapy students completed a self-report questionnaire comprised of demographic questions and two standardised scales: Resilience at University (RAU) and Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA). Students’ practice education performance was measured by the Student Practice Evaluation Form–Revised (SPEF–R). Multi-linear regression analyses with bootstrapping were completed to identify resilience factors that were predictive of occupational therapy students’ practice performance. Results: Overall, occupational therapy students reported high levels of resilience based on the RAU and RSA subscale scores. “Managing Stress,” “Find Your Calling” and “Living Authentically” were strong predictors of a range of key fieldwork performance SPEF–R factors, including “Professional Behaviours,” “Self-management Skills,” “Co-worker Communication” and “Communication Skills.”. Conclusion: The resilience factors identified as being significant predictors of practice education performance outcomes in occupational therapy students represent notable findings. They suggest that students’ capabilities in managing their stress levels, finding meaning in their chosen profession, and engaging self-care daily activities outside of the work environment that are meaningful, authentic and fit with one's personal values and beliefs can act as buffers against the challenges experienced by students who are completing practice education placements. The findings will assist academic and practice educators in identifying and targeting vulnerable students and strengthening resilience strategies through proactive pre-practice placement initiatives. Qualitative studies are recommended to further explore the relationship between resilience and practice education performance in occupational therapy students. © 2019 Occupational Therapy Australia","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Sleep deprivation influences many aspects of a person’s life and it is often associated with disturbed mood and anxiety problems and influences the academic achievement and work quality among the students. Dental specialty is often loaded with higher levels of didactic and clinical content, which exerts stress on students as it demands long hours of study and practice, because of this the sleeping hours are reduced and this affects the mental, psychological and physical status. To find the difference in sleep pattern among the dental students. A self-administered questionnaire comprising about 18 questions was prepared and circulated through online to a sample population of 100 dental college students. 28.7% of dental college students have sleep deprivation for days and weeks, 34.7% of them have acute insomnia, and 36.6% of them have chronic insomnia and among them 4% are taking medications for insomnia. This survey concludes that most dental students have healthier sleep patterns and only very few lack good sleep due to sleep disorders. Hence students should accustom themselves to a healthier sleep pattern to enhance academic performance and to avoid health and psychological related hazards. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

With a strong cultural emphasis on school performance, Chinese American families may be particularly vulnerable to such stress. In the current research, Chinese American adolescents (N = 95; Mean age = 13.7 years; 51% girls) and their parents completed daily diary reports of school problems and emotional well-being for 14 continuous days. Adolescents also provided four saliva samples per day for 4 consecutive days. Multilevel modeling analyses showed that youth’s daily school problems predicted their lower happiness, higher distress, and higher total cortisol output above and beyond their emotional well-being and cortisol output the prior day. Moreover, there was a spillover effect such that youth’s school problems also negatively predicted their parents’ emotional well-being. Notably, the negative influence from school problems was moderated by children’s cultural orientation, such that youth who were more oriented toward Chinese (vs. American) culture were more vulnerable to the school problems. Taken together, our results highlight the costs on biopsychological adjustment accompanying the academic focus in Chinese American youth and their parents. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

DESIGN: Institution-based cross-sectional study design. SETTING: College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: 386 participants were recruited for self-administered interview using the stratified followed by simple random sampling technique. MEASUREMENT: Data were collected by self-administered interview. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) was used to measure PMDD. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Oslo-3 social support are used to assess the factors. The data were checked, cleaned and entered into EpiData V.3.1 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) V.21.0 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regressions were used. OR with 95% CI was employed to see the strength of associations between dependent and independent variables. Variables with a p value <0.05 in multivariable logistic regression were declared as significantly associated. RESULT: 386 participants were involved in the study, with a response rate of 84.6%. The overall magnitude of PMDD in this study was 34.7% (30.3 to 39.1). Severe menstrual pain (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.82, 95% CI: 1.83 to 4.23), perception of an impact on academic performance due to menstrual pain (AOR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.23 to 4.32), and high perceived stress (AOR=3.52, 95% CI: 2.58 to 5.60) were significantly associated with PMDD disorder among female medical and health sciences students. CONCLUSION: PMDD is high among female medical and health sciences students. Thus, it needs early screening and intervention especially for those who have severe menstrual pain, perceived to have an impact on academic performance and high perceived stress. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

As mental health and wellbeing strongly correlate with students’ academic performance and general overseas experience, a growing number of studies focus on what universities can do to effectively support students’ wellbeing. However, assumptions are made about what wellbeing is, strategies primarily focus on treating mental ill-health, and treatment approaches fail to account for cultural differences. This study aimed to explore how Chinese international students understand wellbeing, the language used about and for wellbeing, and activities that students believe strengthen their own and others’ wellbeing. Eighty-four Chinese international students completed the online survey, and a subset of 30 students participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using thematic, phenomenographic, and language analyses. Physical health and mental health appeared as the key components that participants believed defined wellbeing, and intrapersonal activities were perceived as the primary approach used to strengthen wellbeing. Findings help broaden the understanding of wellbeing concept from the population of tertiary students, identify students’ perspectives of activities that strengthen their wellbeing, offer a snapshot of the language used by Chinese students around wellbeing, and provide new data of population health through a wellbeing lens. © 2020 by the authors.

Although said stress may be useful to meet such demands, in many cases, it can have a negative impact on their health. Objective: To assess whether the implementation of active meditation in the daily routine of health sciences university students impacts their physical and psycho-emotional stress indicators. Materials and methods: Exploratory and quantitative pilot study carried out in a sample of 22 university students who agreed to participate in a 3-month active meditation elective course (18 sessions). Participants were asked to fill out the Global State Perception Questionnaire (CPGE) ex-ante and ex-post taking the course. Results: 18 participants completed the GSPC ex-ante and ex-post, but only 16 were valid for data processing. Most students reported an improvement in their perception of coping with different stressful situations after completing the course. For example, 87.5% reported remaining in a relaxed state during stressful situations, 81% stated feeling decreased mental exhaustion, and 81% said they were better at handling stressful situations. Conclusions: The implementation of active meditation in the daily routine of this group of university students decreased their physical and psycho-emotional indicators of stress. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out new studies with larger samples to confirm the positive effect of this type of course on the health of university students, which will undoubtedly lead to better academic performance as a result of a better mental state. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

About 1.5% of the sample had regular IDU, 19% occasional IDU, and 79% never IDU. Independent predictors of ever (lifetime) IDU included males [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.82, P = 0.001], not living with parents (AOR 2.59, P < 0.001), singles (AOR 0.51, P < 0.001), lower religiosity (AOR 1.49, P = 0.022), better self-rated general health (AOR 0.41, P = 0.003), higher health awareness (AOR 1.93, P = 0.014), more depressive symptoms (AOR 1.82, P = 0.004), daily smokers (AOR 3.69, P < 0.001), heavy episodic drinking (AOR 2.38, P < 0.001) and possible alcohol dependency (AOR 2.55, P < 0.001). We observed no independent associations between ever IDU with age, study discipline, perceived stress or academic performance. The 20.5% ever IDU is concerning. The compelling independent predictors of ever IDU included not living with parents, lower religiosity, daily smokers, heavy episodic drinking and possible alcohol dependency (AOR range 2.38–3.69). Education and prevention need to emphasize the negative consequences to reinforce abstinence from IDU.

The present research examined the role of these factors in the well-being of doctoral students. Background Imposter syndrome has long been discussed both formally and informally as a prevalent experience of doctoral students. Existing research provides empirical support for the role of perceived belongingness to one's scholarly community in maladaptive self-perceptions (i.e., imposter syndrome), as well as the role of imposter syndrome in doctoral students' well-being. However, no studies to date have directly explored the extent to which imposter syndrome mediates the relationship between perceived belongingness and well-being in a single model. Methodology The present research sought to evaluate perceived belongingness as a predictor of imposter syndrome and how imposter syndrome, in turn, predicts well-being (i.e., depression, stress, and illness symptoms) in doctoral students. Depression, stress, and illness symptoms were identified in the literature as the most prevalent well-being concerns reported by doctoral students and therefore were evaluated as the outcome variables in the present research. In line with previous research, we expected perceived belongingness to negatively predict imposter syndrome, and imposter syndrome, in turn, to positively predict depression, stress, and illness symptoms. Two studies evaluated the proposed model. Data for both studies was collected simultaneously (i.e., one large sample) with 25% of the sample randomly selected for Study 1 (cross-sectional) and the remainder included in Study 2 (longitudinal). In Study 1, we tested this hypothesis with a cross-sectional design and explored whether imposter syndrome was a significant mediator between perceived belongingness and well-being. In Study 2, we aimed to replicate and extend the results of Study 1 with a prospective design to further assess the directionality of the relationship from perceived belongingness to imposter syndrome and, in turn, the role of imposter syndrome in changes in depression, stress, and illness symptoms over a five-month period. Contribution The present results represent evidence of the process by which doctoral students develop imposter syndrome and some of the consequences of imposter syndrome on doctoral well-being. Additionally, the present study includes a large-scale sample of international doctoral students across the disciplines, thus revealing the prevalence of imposter syndrome in the doctoral experience. Findings Overall, the results of the present research provided support for our hypotheses. In Study 1, perceived belongingness was found to be a negative predictor of imposter syndrome that, in turn, predicted higher levels of depression, stress, and illness symptoms. Additionally, imposter syndrome was found to significantly mediate the relationship between perceived scholarly belongingness and the three outcome variables assessing psychological well-being. Study 2 further revealed perceived scholarly belongingness to negatively predict imposter syndrome five months later, with imposter syndrome, in turn, predicting increases in depression, stress, and illness symptoms in our doctoral student sample. Recommendations Several recommendations are made for practitioner based on the present find-for Practitioners ings: First, by acknowledging the critical role of perceived social belongingness in students' well-being, faculty and administrators can establish structures to better integrate students into their scholarly communities, and departments can foster a supportive social atmosphere for their doctoral students that emphasizes the quality of interactions and consultation with faculty. Second, information sessions for first-year doctoral students could highlight the prevalence and remedies of feeling like an impostor to normalize these otherwise deleterious feelings of inadequacy. Finally, professional development seminars that are typically taught in graduate programs could incorporate an explicit discussion of well-being topics and the prevalence of imposter syndrome, alongside other pragmatic topics (e.g., publishing protocols), to ensure that students perceive their departmental climate as supportive and, in turn, feel less like an imposter and better psychologically adjusted. Recommendations Researchers should continue exploring the various antecedents and consefor Researchers quences of imposter syndrome, specifically focusing on at-risk students, as well as the role of imposter syndrome in doctoral-level dropout. Impact on Society Imposter syndrome is a harmful experience that can lead to a variety of life-altering outcomes, such as developing or intensifying a mental illness. Doctoral students, as society's future researchers and high-skilled professionals, have a great impact on society as a whole, and efforts should be extended into maintaining doctoral students' well-being in order for them to perform at an optimal level. The present research sheds light on one aspect of the doctoral experience that is detrimental to the well-being of doctoral students, thus informing doctoral students, advisors, and departments of one area where more resources can be allocated in order to facilitate the health, both physical and psychological, of their students. Future Research Future research should explore additional outcomes to fully understand the impact of perceived belongingness and imposter syndrome on doctoral students. Some such outcomes may include academic performance (e.g., presentation /publication rates), motivation (e.g., perseverance vs. intention to quit), and more general psychological adjustment measures (e.g., satisfaction with life). Such research, in combination with the present findings, can help the understanding of the full impact of imposter syndrome on the academic and personal experiences of doctoral students and can contribute to psychologically healthier and more academically productive experiences for doctoral students as they navigate the myriad challenges of doctoral education. © 2020 Informing Science Institute.

Studies have shown that students’ involvement in physical activity may influence their mental health and academic performance. In addition, more participation in physical activity can lead to better mental health and academic performance among students. This study was designed to identify the association between physical activity and academic performance among University of Cyberjaya (UoC) pharmacy students. This study also to assess the association between physical activity and mental health among UoC pharmacy students. Not only that, this study also aims to determine the association between mental health and academic performance among UOC pharmacy students. A guided self-administered questionnaire was used to determine the level of physical activity, severity of depression, anxiety and stress and including Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of the pharmacy students. The questionnaire is consisting of 3 parts; demographic data, level of physical activity and severity of depression, anxiety and stress. This study involved 316 respondents from Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) course of UoC. The respondents who participated were mostly females (76.3%). This study found that there is no significant association between level of physical activity and CGPA. Moreover, there was a significant association between physical activity and severity of depression, anxiety and stress (p < 0.05). This study also found that there was a significant association between severity of depression, anxiety and stress with CGPA. This concluded that UoC pharmacy students had a good level of physical activity and mental health including CGPA. Further similar study can be done by involving pharmacy students from different universities, to provide an overall picture of Malaysian pharmacy students regarding relationship between physical activity, mental health and academic performance. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

There has been limited research on psychological distress levels in students prior to starting medicine and no direct comparison between undergraduate and graduate-entry students. Methods: Psychological distress was assessed using the 21-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale in 168 undergraduate-entry and 84 graduate-entry medical students at two separated campuses of the same university in the orientation week prior to starting classes. Mean scores and severity proportions were compared between the two cohorts of students. Demographic data was also collected and compared to distress scores using subgroup analysis. Results: The response rate for the study was 60.9%. The majority of undergraduate and graduate-entry medical students were within the normal limits for depression (67.2% versus 70.2%, p = 0.63), anxiety (56.5% versus 44.0%, p = 0.06), and stress scores (74.4% versus 64.2%, p = 0.10). There was no significant difference between severity groups except for severe stress (2.3% versus 9.5%, p = 0.01). The mean scores of the clinically distressed groups indicated moderate levels of depression, moderate anxiety, and moderate stress scores. There were no significant differences between undergraduate or graduate-entry students for depressive (x- = 17.02 versus 15.76, p = 0.43), anxiety (x- = 14.22 versus 13.28, p = 0.39), and stress scores (x- = 20.83 versus 22.46, p = 0.24). Female gender and self-believed financial concerns were found be associated with higher levels stress in graduate entry students. Conclusions: The majority of medical students enter medical school with normal levels of psychological distress. However, a large number of undergraduate and graduate-entry medical students have significant levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress levels, without a significant difference between undergraduate or graduate-entry students. There are several limitation of this study but the results suggest that education and intervention may be required to support students from the earliest weeks of medical school. © 2020 Sean R.

Methods: 99 undergraduate students (Mage = 19.9, SD = 1.1), 60% female and 72% first-year students, completed a neuropsychological battery and self-report questionnaires at a single lab visit. 56% of the sample identified as “poor sleepers” (>5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]). Results: Poor sleepers reported worse current (college grade point average [GPA]) but not past (high school GPA, American college test [ACT] score) academic performance. Additionally, they reported more mental health concerns, including depression and stress, but not anxiety. Poor sleepers reported more functional impairment and subjective cognitive concerns, including more Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms, more SCT symptoms, and more executive dysfunction, even when controlling for depressive symptoms. However, poor sleepers did not differ from good sleepers on measures of objective cognition. Conclusions: ADHD and SCT symptoms and concerns in college students may be related to poor sleep, which can lead to misdiagnosis for individuals presenting with ADHD-like complaints for the first time in college. Sleep difficulties may be modifiable with empirically supported sleep interventions; thus, in assessment for either of these presentations, a careful sleep history should be taken. © The Author(s) 2020.

In the MV, astronauts or other participants should be exposed to psychological and physical stressors similar to those they would encounter on the International Space Station (ISS), such as isolation and confinement, limited habitability, interpersonal issues, microgravity and space radiation; this could lead to the identification of new and previously unknown stressors. To assess the physiological and psychological responses to a stay in a variety of isolated, confined and extreme (ICE) environments, and to survey psychological interpersonal communication between the crew in such environments, a number of confinement studies simulating the conditions of the ISS, the Mir space station and potential habitats on the Moon and Mars, including the Isolation Study for European Manned Space Infrastructure, Experimental Campaign for the European Manned Space Infrastructure, Simulation of Flight of International Crew on Space Station, Human Behavior in Extended Spaceflight, Mars-500, Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, and Human Exploration Research Analog, have been conducted. In those studies on responses to ICE environments, astronauts were exposed to psychological stressors such as isolation and confinement, limited habitability and interpersonal issues with crew members and/or ground staff, in addition to physical stressors such as microgravity and space radiation. Excessive psychological stress perturbs the homeostasis of living creatures and can cause tissue damage and disease. In addition, extremely high mental workloads and uncontrolled stressors can impair cognitive abilities such as working memory, executive function and cognitive efficiency. The negative effects of psychological stress on astronauts' health and performance are expected to be a serious issue in the MV because it will be further from Earth and have a longer duration of space flight compared with previous missions. The effects of long-term stays in ICE environments have been studied in the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions. In 2016, the Science Union of Human Planetary Habitation in Space was established in Japan. This union seeks to collate wisdom from applied to basic research into the natural sciences, as well as from the human and social sciences, with the aim of fostering cooperation and uniting individuals and academic societies to enable humans to survive long durations in space. However, to resolve new and previously unknown problems in the MV, a multidisciplinary approach is needed. © 2020 by DLR-SART.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Some students are at higher risk of struggling based on background educational or demographic factors. Struggling students are often identified during written examinations, clinical performance evaluations, formal professionalism evaluations, peer assessments, group learning sessions, and standardized patient encounters. Students struggle for diverse reasons including content amount, inadequate study skills and learning strategies, test-taking difficulty, learning disabilities, and noncognitive reasons (stress, anxiety, depression, life events, etc.). Unfortunately, struggling students have been shown to respond to poor academic performance by avoiding seeking help, which only compounds the problem. These help-avoiding behaviors are complex and are likely tied to the stigma related to poor performance. Ultimately, these students may feel pressured to take time off or drop out of medical school altogether. Because both schools and students devote valuable time and resources to training, it is imperative to create a support system for these students. There have been many types of support services described in the literature including tutoring/mentoring, skill development/assessment, test-taking, disability services, and mental health services. ""Best practices"" of support programs have been poorly studied. However, the literature suggests that key components of successful programs include delivering a broad range of services, offering services to students early in medical school, establishing a psychologically safe and emotionally supportive environment, integrating cohesively with the medical curriculum, having trained staff, developing an individualized learning plan, fostering development as reflective learners, coaching students longitudinally, and having procedures in place to evaluate program efficacy. Future research needs to focus on identifying students at risk of struggling, determining interventions that can promote help-seeking behaviors, comparing the effect of various support service interventions on outcomes of struggling students, and developing meaningful interventions for struggling third and fourth year medical students. This chapter provides a comprehensive framework for institutions aiming to improve academic support for struggling students. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We meta-analyzed HRQOL outcomes reported by people with a Fontan circulation or their proxies and evaluated predictors of poorer HRQOL. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language articles published before March 2019. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated using fixed and random-effects models. Fifty articles reporting on 29 unique studies capturing HRQOL outcomes for 2793 people with a Fontan circulation and 1437 parent-proxies were analyzed. HRQOL was lower in individuals with a Fontan circulation compared with healthy referents or normative sam-ples (SMD, −0.92; 95% CI, −1.36 to −0.48; P<0.001). Lower scores were reported across all HRQOL domains, with the largest differences found for physical (SMD, −0.90; 95% CI, −1.13 to −0.67; P<0.001) and school/work functioning (SMD, −0.71; 95% CI, −0.90 to −0.52; P<0.001). Meta-regression analyses found no significant predictors of self-reported physical functioning, but older age at Fontan operation was associated with poorer emotional functioning (β=−0.124; P=0.004), and diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart was associated with poorer social functioning (β=−0.007; P=0.048). Sensitivity analyses showed use of the PedsQL Core Module was associated with lower HRQOL scores compared with the Short-Form Health Survey-36. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL outcomes for people with a Fontan circulation are lower than the general population. Optimal care acknowledges the lifelong impact of the Fontan circulation on HRQOL and offers targeted strategies to improve outcomes for this growing population. © 2020 The Authors.

The acoustic environment, in particular, influences the emotional health and work performance of them significantly. In the past decades, continuous and in-depth research conducted by the academic community has achieved abundant helpful results based on the extensive application of open-plan offices and the unique acoustic problems associated with the openness of space. This study used the Web of ScienceTM core collection as the data source and employed the visual profiling tools of CiteSpace to analyse domestic and international literatures on environmental and architectural acoustics, psychoacoustics, environmental psychology, ergonomics, human factors and other related fields and then summarise research hotspots and outcomes as well as critical health-related problems and their impacts. Previous studies have reported that the influence of indoor noises is greater than that of outdoor noises. The primary source of noise in an open-plan office is “irrelevant speech”, which is a background conversation sound between other colleagues; further, “speech privacy” is the most critical problem associated with the acoustic environment of the open-plan office. The language transmission index (STI) can appropriately characterise the speech privacy of a space. Additionally, based on the research results of “Speech Prediction Method” and “STI-Ergonomic Model”, the International Organization for Standardization has formulated ISO3382-3, an acoustic environment measurement standard for open-plan offices. By utilising an appropriate translation method, China has developed and formulated the national standard GB/T36075. 3. The adverse effects of the acoustic environment problems can be summarised into “psychological interference” and “cognitive interference”. The former results in “sound annoyance” and strengthens negative emotions, including fatigue, stress, and irritability, whereas the latter reduces cognitive performance and increases the cognitive load of the workers. Thus, the office workers’ acoustic environment experience and its health impact are related to the space type, work type, language type, and individual differences; however, the conclusions are insufficient. Acoustic masking is an effective methodology to improve the speech privacy in a space, but it can cause acoustic comfort problems. Exploration of the types and sound pressure levels of masking sounds, their spatial presentation, workers’ comfort experience, masking performance and efficiency, and the relationship between these factors has become a research hotspot in recent years. To ensure the healthfulness and comfort of the acoustic environment of open-plan office, further promotion at the level of theoretical research as well as technical inquiry and management should be conducted. This includes establishing an evaluation criterion that fits the characteristics of China’s office space and the Chinese language environment as soon as possible because it forms the basis for occupational health management, office building design, and acoustic environment transformation. Meanwhile, the academic investigation and application exploration of the technical methods, such as acoustic masking, is being promoted to enhance the acoustic performance of the open-plan office to obtain a technical solution that can be promoted and applied. In addition, the exploration of the sound-related environmental health issues associated with the open-plan office using advanced technologies, such as the physiological measurement technology, eyetracking technology, and virtual reality presentations, is expected to obtain considerably significant academic benefits. © 2020, Science Press.

This study aimed to investigate how physical education participation predicts suicidal ideation and stress in South Korean high school students. Data from the Twelfth Korea Youth Risk Behaviour Web-Based Survey 2016 (KYRBS) were used for analyses. Two multiple logistic regressions were performed to determine the influence of selected factors on suicidal ideation and stress (model 1: subjective health, social support, body mass index, academic achievement, perceived economic status of family, and physical education participation; model 2: adjusting for school type and year). Model 2 revealed negative associations between subjective health, academic achievement, perceived economic status of family, social support, physical education participation (≥2 times/weekly), and suicidal ideation for male students. Female students exhibited negative associations between subjective health, social support, and academic achievement, along with a positive association between body mass index and suicidal ideation. For both genders, stress was negatively associated with subjective health, social support, academic achievement, perceived economic status of family, and physical education participation (≥2 times/weekly).

This study hypothesized that there would be differences among student subgroups in the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress; and association of age, gender, academic performance and mental health status. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey study. Since 2014, first-year university students in a university in Hong Kong were invited to complete the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) before the commencement of their study. These DASS data were then merged with objectively measured data from university records. 9,479 students completed the DASS survey, this being 56.5% of the total student population in the records. Kruskal-Wallis Tests were applied to compare the differences among student subgroups. Results: Community college transfer (CCT) students were the highest-risk group for depression, anxiety and stress, and their study load was the highest as well. Unexpectedly, mainstream students ranked after the CCT students in the prevalence and levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Student athletes had the highest prevalence of depression. Although there were declining trends for depression, anxiety and stress, it was only a slight drop. Overall, age, gender, study load and academic performance were associated with the mental health profile (p<0.05). Limitations: After admission, students’ mental health conditions could have changed. Further studies are needed to measure mental health during their study. Conclusions: Mental health problems were not distributed evenly across different student subgroups, psychological support should be designed according to the needs of each student subgroup. © 2020 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, there are very few studies on cyberbullying among university students, especially in Myanmar. This study aims to determine the percentage of university students who suffered cyberbullying victimization in the last 12 months, and the association between students’ socio-demographic characteristics, adverse events following cyberbullying and cyberbullying victimization. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among university students aged 18 years and older at one medical university in Magway, Myanmar. A total of 412 students (277 males and 135 females) participated in the study. Data were collected from August to September, 2018 using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analyses (models I and II) were performed to estimate the unadjusted (UOR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results In total, 40.8% of males and 51.1% of females in the study had suffered cyberbullying victimization in the past 12 months. In model I, students who had been studying at the university for 3 years or less (AOR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.14–2.85), and who had witnessed psychological, physical or sexual violence, or cyberbullying in their neighborhoods, (AOR = 2.95; 95% CI 1.48–5.91) were more likely to have suffered cyberbullying victimization in the past 12 months. In model II, being a victim of cyberbullying was associated with difficulties in concentrating and understanding lectures (AOR = 3.96; 95% CI 1.72–9.11), and substance abuse (AOR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.02–5.49). Non-resident students were at a higher risk of being cyberbullying victims than their resident peers (AOR = 1.86; 95% CI 1.04–3.34). Conclusion Two out of five students had suffered cyberbullying victimization in the past 12 months, and only half of the victims discussed their experience(s) with someone else. Students who suffered cyberbullying victimization faced academic difficulties and started or increased smoking, betel chewing or alcohol drinking. Counter measures to prevent and mitigate the adverse events related to cyberbullying victimization are urgently needed among university students in Myanmar. Periodic screening for cyberbullying, counseling services, cyber-safety educational programs, and awareness raising campaigns should be implemented. © 2020 Khine et al.

Given that certain substances have been frequently used for years, the long-term eŠectiveness and safety are essential to know but particularly difficult and costly to determine. Although PCE is a widespread and frequent phenomenon among university students in other countries, PCE prevalence in Japan has not been elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of and the attitude toward PCE among Japanese undergraduates over 3 years (2017-2019). Almost no student had ever used prescription drugs for cognitive enhancement. When asked, ``Would you like to use drugs to enhance your cognitive performance?'' 68.6-72.0％ of the students answered, ``No,'' 25.4-26.7％ answered, ``I couldn't say,'' and 2.5-4.8％ answered, ``Yes.'' These answers were associated with sex (2017-2018) and stress sensitivity (2019) but not with drinking, smoking, or stress of academic performance. Half of the students had used energy drinks for neural enhancement prior to an examination, which is similar to Western usage. The users of soft enhancers, such as energy drinks, are more likely to use other drugs. Given that caŠeine can be a gateway for cognitive enhancement, future education addressing PCE among students should emphasize the side eŠects of prescription drugs as well as health risks of caŠeine products. © 2020 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Our purpose was to assess the stress levels of Nursing students before and during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Murcia (Spain), its influence on taking an online exam and how it was affected by physical exercise. This was an observational and prospective study including Nursing students from the second year of the Nursing Degree from 3 February to 23 April 2020. Three measurements were performed: one before lockdown and two during lockdown. Stress increased substantially during lockdown. Financial, family or emotional problems, as well as physical exercise, also increased. Indeed, at 40 days of lockdown, those students with financial, family or emotional problems, and less physical exercise reported significantly higher stress levels. In addition, those who passed the online exam had lower stress levels compared to those who failed. In conclusion, during lockdown, stress in Nursing students increased. This could be triggered by students’ personal problems, and physical exercise may be used as a way to reduce stress. Academic performance was better in those students reporting less stress. © 2020 by the authors.

The purpose of this scoping review was to identify, summarise, and describe the current state of knowledge on mindfulness in allied health and social care professional education. Methods: Arksey and O’Malley’s scoping review methodology was adopted. Five data bases were searched; inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied; and 50 papers were identified for inclusion in the study. Results: Quantitative studies depicted mindfulness interventions as contributing to: improved capacities for mindfulness; decreases in stress, anxiety, and depression; improvements in academic skills, quality of life and well-being, and empathy; improved physiological measures and emotional regulation; and mixed effects on burn-out. Qualitative studies highlighted: 1) mindfulness and self-care, 2) mindfulness within professional practice placements, 3) mindfulness in the classroom, and 4) the cultivation of mindful qualities. Conclusions: The study has important implications for the education of future rehabilitation professions and suggests that learning about mindfulness may be useful in assisting students to: manage academic stress, anxiety, and depression; cultivate a physical and mental state of calm; be more present and empathetic with clients; and be more focused and attentive in professional practice settings.Implications for rehabilitation Further exploration of mindfulness as a promising educational intervention for the professional preparation of future rehabilitation practitioners in allied health and social care fields is recommended. Education and research about mindfulness and its potential opportunities for students in terms of the mediation of stress, anxiety, depression, and the cultivation of empathy, academic skills, quality of life, and resilience are recommended. Education and research about mindfulness and its potential for the cultivation of beneficial qualities of mind such as attention, self-awareness, compassion, non-judgment, and acceptance are recommended. Education and research about mindfulness as a potential means to develop capacities related to self-care, professional practice placements, and classroom performance in students is recommended. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of 45 decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants versus 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to 45 dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes. Objectives: Primary objective. To determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates. Secondary objectives. 1. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity). 2. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age. 3. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance. 4. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings 2000 to 2014 (Abstracts2ViewTM), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November 2014. Selection criteria: Preterm infants (< 32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or < 1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit. Data collection and analysis: We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results: One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of < 48 hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been > 48 hours old. There was no significant difference in weight at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (MD) 111 g (95% confidence interval (CI) -151 to 374 g) (n = 23). There was no significant difference in weight at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.31 kg, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16 kg (n = 14). There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87 (n = 12), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD -2.16, 95% CI -18.44 to 14.12 (n =12). Authors' conclusions: To date, only 34 infants have been enrolled in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of reducing sound levels that reach the infants' ears in the NICU. Based on the small sample size of this single trial, we cannot make any recommendations for clinical practice. Larger, well designed, conducted and reported trials are needed.

The sports world is also suffering enormous consequences, such as the suspension of the Olympic Games in Tokyo or, in chess, the cancelation of the World Candidates Tournament 2020. Chess is a sport characterized by high psychophysiological demands derived from long training durations, tournaments, and games, leading to mental, emotional, and physical stress. These characteristics could provide chess players a certain advantage in facing quarantine situations. This study aimed to analyze the effect of COVID-19 confinement on behavioral, psychological, and training patterns of chess players based on their gender, level of education, and level of chess played. We analyzed chess players (N: 450; age = 38.12 ± 14.01 years) in countries where confinement was mandatory: Professional players (N: 55; age = 43.35 ± 13), high-performance players (N: 53; age = 38.57 ± 13.46), competitive players (N: 284; age = 36.82 ± 13.91), and amateur players (N: 58; age = 39.10 ± 14.99). Results showed that chess players significantly decreased physical activity per day while increased chess practise during the confinement period. However, anxiety levels remained moderate despite the anti-stress effects of physical activity. Amateur players showed a significantly higher level of social alarm than professional and high-performance players. Moreover, professional players showed higher values of extraversion than high-performance players and amateur players. In neuroticism, professional players showed higher values than high-performance players. In addition, the professional players showed higher scores in psychological inflexibility than competitive players. Finally, chess players with the highest academic level showed higher levels of personal concern and anxiety due to COVID-19 as well as lower psychological inflexibility compared to those with a lower academic level. In conclusion, chess players, especially those with a higher academic level, might have adapted their psychological profile to fit confinement situations and the worrying levels of physical inactivity. © Copyright © 2020 Fuentes-García, Martínez Patiño, Villafaina and Clemente-Suárez.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine male and female adolescent’s perceptions towards their motor competence and identity development. In-depth information was also collected to understand what factors are important towards identity development during adolescence. Method: An explanatory sequential mixed methods study was used to examine the extent motor competence influenced the health of an adolescent’s identity. A sample of 160 adolescents (male n = 103, female n = 57, Mage = 14.45 SD = .75) completed the Adolescent Motor Competence Questionnaire (AMCQ) and the Assessment of Identity Development in Adolescence (AIDA). The AMCQ scores were used to group the participants into high (HMC = > 83) and low (LMC = < 83) motor competence. Results: More females had less-healthy identities than males and those with LMC had less-healthy identities than those with HMC. Subsamples of 17 participants were interviewed in order to explain these results. The most at risk group, females with LMC, identified negative peer comparisons, poor social support and higher stress levels to achieve academic performance as key challenges. Conclusions. Well-designed support services for those with LMC, especially for the females should incorporate activities to develop individual competency and close friendships. © 2019, © 2019 SHAPE America.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among pharmacy students in Nigeria is unknown. Objective: This study sought to examine the occurrence of depression, anxiety and stress and associated sociodemographic factors among undergraduate pharmacy students in Nigeria. Methods: The study was an online-based cross-sectional descriptive survey conducted among students from seven pharmacy schools in Nigeria. Students were recruited via their class WhatsApp groups and a link to a Google Form was provided for those who agreed to participate in the study. Data were analysed using IBM Statistical Product and Services Solution for Windows version 21.0. Results: A total of 408 students out of approximately 3,068 students responded to the survey (response rate: 13.32%). The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 44.6%, 63.5%, and 35%, respectively. Depression was found to be strongly correlated with stress (r=0.739, p<0.001) and anxiety (r=0.715, p<0.001). Depression, anxiety and stress scores significantly correlated with perceived academic performance and year of study. There was no significant association between gender, cigarette smoking, type of accommodation, and the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among pharmacy students responding to a survey in Nigeria was high. Students in lower years of study and those with perceived poor academic performance had higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress. More studies are needed to explore the causes of depression, anxiety and stress among pharmacy students. © 2020 FIP.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

A convenience sample of full-time students at a public university was recruited for a 5-week study conducted mostly using an online platform. Participants were randomly assigned to a Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy (MBAT) intervention or a Neutral Clay Task (NCT). Anxiety, perceived stress, and salivary cortisol outcomes were measured. A total of n = 77 participants completed the study. The MBAT group experienced significant reductions in anxiety and perceived stress compared to the NCT group. Significant reductions in salivary cortisol were observed, but only time could be identified as a confounding variable. Art making alone is not enough to induce significant positive responses, but this study suggests MBAT can, and that an online intervention could offer feasible and accessible mental health services on college campuses. Further refinement of biological data collection and analysis is needed to determine what the mediating effects MBAT could have, if any, at the molecular level. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Transitioning from adolescence to young adulthood requires adaptation to more demanding social interactions, academic pressures, and individual responsibilities which place distinct demands on neurocognitive functions. This study examined longitudinal trajectories of neurocognitive test performance in the domains of processing speed (PS), working memory (WM), and executive functioning (EF) among PHIV and demographically similar PHEU from adolescence through young adulthood. Data for this paper come from four time points, spanning approximately 10 years, within the Child and Adolescent Self-Awareness and Health Study (CASAH). Youth age ranged from 15 to 29 years. Longitudinal linear mixed effect models were computed for each test. Few differences in performance were found on tests of EF and WM between PHIV and PHEU youth as they aged, though PHEU youth showed significantly better PS as they aged than PHIV youth. Future research is needed to understand these vulnerable youth’s neurocognitive trajectories as a function of HIV infection and -exposure, biological functions and psychosocial stressors. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

With the limited studies investigating this issue in Sudan, this study aimed at assessing psychiatric morbidity, determine stressors, evaluate mental health care seeking behavior and barriers to seeking help among medical stude nts in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods: this was a cross-sectional study with data collection for a period of one month, during the survey. Following ethical clearance and administrative approval, 644 students who gave consent were selected randomly from the university of Khartoum’s faculty of medicine. The “12-General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12)” was used as a tool to assess prevalence of psychiatric morbidity, determine stressors and evaluate barriers to seeking mental health care among students for a period of a month. Results: the overall prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was 56% (n = 356). The mean score of the GHQ12 was 6.7. There was a statistically significant association between GHQ12-score and level of study (in medical school), age, student’s income (student financial allowance). Stressors mostly experienced by students were fear of academic failure, dissatisfaction with academic performance and examination stress. The most frequent barriers to seeking mental health care elicited by participant s were fear of stigmatization 63% (n = 401), preference for dealing with the problem alone 60% (n = 379), fear of the unknown 59% (n = 365) and failure to recognize symptoms 58% (n = 366). Conclusion: psychiatric morbidity is commonly experienced by students in medical school as can be seen from the high prevalence (56%). The reported high figures of psychiatric morbidity among medical school students points to the urgency for interventions to address this problem with potential for negative sequelae (personal and professional). Our findings suggest that intervent ions to improve the social and economic conditions of students in medical school as well as addressing stigma related to mental health and educating students to recognize signs and symptoms of psychiatric morbidity while making help accessible might go a long way to address this challenge. © Muwada Bashir Awad Bashir et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This process is susceptible to errors and inefficiencies particularly if poor teamwork in this multidisciplinary and ad hoc collaboration occurs. Through combining provider- and observer-rated team performance, we aimed to determine agreement levels on team performance and associations with mental demands, disruptions, and stress. An observational and multisource study of provider and concomitant expert-observer ratings was established. In an Academic Paediatric Hospital, we conducted standardized observations of postsurgical handovers to PICU. We applied established observational and self-reported teamwork tools. Nested fixed and mixed models were established to estimate agreement within teams, between providers’ and observer’s ratings, as well as for estimations between team performance and mental demands, disruptions, and stress outcomes. Thirty-one postsurgical patient handovers were included with overall 109 ratings of involved providers. Provider-perceived team performance was rated high. Within the receiving sub-team, situation awareness was perceived lower compared to the handoff sub-team [F(df = 1) = 4.41, p =.04]. Inter-provider agreement on handover team performance was low for the overall team yet higher within handover sub-teams. We observed that high level of distractions during the handover was associated with inferior team performance rated by observers (B = − 0.72, 95% CI = − 1.44, − 0.01). Conclusion: We observed substantial disagreements on how involved professionals as well as observers rated teamwork during patient transfers. Investigations into paediatric teamwork and particular team-based handovers should carefully consider if concurrent provider and observer assessments are a valid and reliable way to evaluate teamwork in paediatric care. Common handover language should be established and mandatory before jointly evaluating this process. Our findings advocate also that handovers should be performed under low levels of distractions.What is Known:• Efficient teamwork during transfers of critically ill children is fundamental to quality and safety of handover practice.• Postoperative handovers are often performed by ad hoc teams of caregivers with multiple backgrounds and are prone to suboptimal team performance, communication, and information transfer.What is New:• Our provider and expert evaluations of team performance during OR-PICU handovers showed poor agreement for team performance. Our findings challenge previous results drawing upon single source assessments and inform future studies to carefully consider what approach of team performance assessments is required.• We further demonstrate that high levels of disruptions are associated with poor team performance during patient handovers and that efforts to ensure undisrupted handover practices in clinical care are necessary. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The purpose of this study was to examine the academic performance of students who develop their pre-professional practices, to see the impact of time dedication to work in companies and the excessive mental workload resulting in this dedicated time. For this, the industrial engineering students of a Peruvian university were taken as a study sample, focusing on determining the mental workload in university students, and how this influences their academic performance. This is evident when the students, in addition to carrying out their regular studies, must develop their pre-professional practices in companies in the industrial sector, for an average of two to three months, with a dedication of at least 30 h per week, with the expected consequences in their academic performance. For this, the impact of the practice was identified in a group of students attending the seventh and eighth academic semester during the period between 2018 and 2019. Subsequently, the number of credits carried by the students who do not develop pre practices is analyzed. professionals and a student who does carry professional practices and how this influence, in the variables of average grades, in the standardized coefficient of performance and in their cognitive abilities. Finally, the application of a mental workload assessment tool was included, which validated the hypothesis of the excessive mental workload that students have during that period and the negative impact it has on the performance of the majority of students involved. These results can be used to better balance the academic load of the students, so that they do not affect their studies as is the case so far. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

In this aspect, the present study aimed to critically analyze the current epidemiological evidence concerning MD adherence of university students' populations. PubMed database was comprehensively searched, using relative keywords. Students' dietary habits are moving away from MD guidelines towards unhealthy eating patterns, especially for those living away from home and even for students with a Mediterranean country origin. Most of the available studies have documented that poorer students' health status was associated with lower MD adherence. Higher MD adherence was correlated with lower depression risk, while higher perceived stress score with lower fruit and vegetables intake. The access of students to information and knowledge provided by courses and lectures did not effectively enhance their compliance to MD. Alarmingly enough, the majority of students, even from medical and nutritional university departments, showed inadequate knowledge on healthy eating habits. Due to the influence of diet on the quality of life and the mental and physical health of students, it is crucial to redirect research focus on this important aspect. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

METHODS: During one academic year, 134 dance and dance-teacher students were monitored on a monthly basis using the Performing artist and Athlete Health Monitor (PAHM). RESULTS: In total, 130 students were included in the analyses, comprising 81 dance students and 49 dance-teacher students. The response rate of the monthly questionnaires was 79.7%. Overall, 96.9% of the students reported at least one physical/mental health problem. The incidence proportion (IP) of all reported mental health issues for one academic year was 44.6% (n=58). Furthermore, 29.2% of the students reported a mental health issue as their most severe health problem, of whom 39.4% indicated a substantial mental health issue (i.e., problems leading to moderate, severe, or complete reductions in training volume or performance). The monthly IP of mental health issues ranged from 2.9 to 8.9% and 0 to 5.3% for substantial mental health issues. The most reported types of mental health issues were general anxiety (20.0%), stress due to external factors (18.3%), and constant tiredness (16.7%). Dance-teacher students of all study years and second-year students from both educational programs indicated significantly more mental health issues, while sex showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary dance students are at risk of mental health issues. Dance schools should pay special attention to stress, anxiety, and (constant) tiredness of their students. More research is needed to gain insight into specific characteristics and risk factors of mental health issues in dance students.  © 2020 Science & Medicine.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The study involved 2456 university students with an average age of 22.51 years. A structural equation model was created to analyse the causal relationships between the variables. The results showed that the psychological controlling of the teacher positively predicted academic stress while autonomy support negatively predicted academic stress. Academic stress negatively predicted motivation, metacognitive strategies, critical thinking and academic performance. Academic motivation positively predicted metacognitive strategies and critical thinking. Finally, metacognitive strategies and critical thinking positively predicted academic performance.

Pharmacy students are exposed to a wide range of stressors during their study. Severe and continued stressors may affect the mental health in variable degrees and may precipitate depression, anxiety and stress which may affect students’ academic performance, physical health and quality of life. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms and also to assess the relationship between these symptoms with stressors faced by the students. A sample of 223 students from Kulliyyah (faculty) of Pharmacy, International Islamic University Malaysia participated in this study. Depression Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to assess the emotional disturbances by determining the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety and stress (DAS) symptoms. The sources of stressors were identified by giving the students a list of the most possible source of stressors which were chosen depending on previous studies, and then the severity of stressors and their relationship with these symptoms were assessed. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms was 50.7%, 72.2%, % and 42.2% respectively but it was found that 11.7%, 33.6% and 11.7% of pharmacy students have clinically significant depression, anxiety and stress respectively. No significant differences between the genders in relation to DAS symptoms. Stressors such as fear of failing, academic overload, fear of unemployment after graduation, exams, and problems in time management were considered the most potent stressors and were significantly associated with DAS symptoms. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress are significantly existent among pharmacy students which need to be early detected. Academic related factors can be viewed as sources of stressors that may induce emotional disturbances among the pharmacy students. © 2020. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

It is hypothesized that graduate construction students experience worse psychological symptoms because of other commitments that they have on top of their work and study. However, research on their mental health is still scarce. This research identifies the stressors and assesses the mental health symptoms of graduate students pursuing construction-related coursework degrees in Australia. In total, 107 valid responses were collected from graduate construction students enrolled in Australian universities through a questionnaire survey. Data analysis suggests that high self-expectations and worrying about under-performing in studies are the most frequent stressors faced by them. They also encounter higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress than the general population. Furthermore, their level of depression is higher than construction professionals in Australia. These adversely affect their academic, work, and social performances. To reduce the attrition rate of graduate students caused by poor psychological health, universities should remodel the delivery methods with balanced online and face-to-face learning activities or intensive options; set the maximum academic load of two subjects per session for students working full-time; and provide in-house educational counselling services. © 2018 Associated Schools of Construction.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 441 medical students from a public-sector university in Pakistan completed a questionnaire from August to December 2018. The questionnaire included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), which measured daytime sleepiness, and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), which measured mental health. Pearson correlations and student t tests were used for comparisons with a significance level of P < .05. Results: Many of the students (44.9%) obtained a high score (≥ 10) on the ESS (ie, experience excessive daytime sleepiness). On average, higher scores on the ESS correlated with higher scores on the GHQ-12. A statistically significant correlation (P < .05) between ESS scores and GHQ-12 scores was obtained when the students with higher (≥ 10) ESS scores were compared with students with lower (< 10) ESS scores. Conclusions: Excessive daytime sleepiness is frequent among medical students and significantly associated with psychological distress. Thus, careful investment in planning appropriate university policies and class schedules is required to encourage healthy and adequate sleep among students, which could have a significant impact on learning, academic performance, and health of medical students. © 2020 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study was designed to evaluate the personal health behavior, including sleep time, of healthcare students at a large health sciences center. Methods An anonymous online survey based on standardized questionnaires about sleep, insomnia, depression, alcohol use, and exercise was sent to all of the healthcare students (including medical, nursing, pharmacy, graduate biomedical science, and allied health students) in the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center graduate education programs in Lubbock. Results In total, 412 students replied to this survey. Their mean sleep duration during the weekday was 7.5 ± 1.2 hours; 16.5% were short sleepers (<7 hours) during weekdays; 33% of the students woke up ""feeling tired or worn out"" >15 days during the last month. Many students were either moderately or severely bothered by ""the lack of energy"" because of poor sleep, and 56.6% of students rated their sleep as either fair or poor. Approximately 35% of students had drinking patterns that qualified as hazardous drinking, 6.3% of students smoked, and 23% of students did not do even mild exercise during the week. Eighty-nine percent of students reported stress in their life, including family stress, job stress, financial stress, legal stress, and other stress. Thirty-five percent of students considered their health as either poor or fair. Approximately 50% of students did not expect any change in their situation during the next 3 to 6 months. Conclusions Although most healthcare students report adequate sleep times, more than half of them rate their sleep as fair or poor. In addition, some have poor health habits, including excessive alcohol use.

The purpose of this research is to explore what signals the prevalence of workplace violence in the Forestry sector; to understand the consequences of workplace violence; to explore the degree to which workplace violence can be stopped; and how can employers strive for a violence “free” and healthy workplace. This chapter focuses on research into workplace violence in the Forestry sector in British Columbia, Canada. A questionnaire survey, telephone interviews, and focus groups were used to focus on managers, union, and employees’ verbal accounts of their own experiences and perceptions of workplace violence. Managers completed 367 questionnaire surveys. The union and employees from across five different organizations also completed the survey that was analyzed. Twenty semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with each interview lasting 60-75 minutes, tape-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Two focus groups were the one with 15 managers only and the other with 10 union representatives. Each focus group lasted 45-60 minutes, tape-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. This research adopted an interpretivist approach, which allows a positivist and an interpretivist viewpoint that examines situations to establish the norm by using questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups. The mixed methodology is appropriate for addressing the research aims and provided insight into the lifeworld of participants, providing the opportunity for managers, union, and employees to share their personal experience of workplace violence. Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) provided insight into the lifeworld of participants, providing the opportunity for employees, managers, and union representative to share their personal experience of workplace violence and its implications for governance, violence prevention, and employee well-being at work. The data revealed that 13 key themes emerged as salient to forestry workers’ perspective of workplace violence, the prevalence of violence, consequences of violence, prevention of violence, and how employers can strive toward a violent “free” and healthy workplace. These themes include Stress Management, Mental Health, Leadership Development, Trust, Employee Involvement and Engagement, Communication and Collaboration, Education and Training, Employee Violence Assistance Program, Violence Response Protocol, Respectful Workplace Culture, Job Redesign, Fear of Change, and Employee Appreciation. This research has relevance for employee well-being, leadership, governance, corporate social responsibility, and performance for practitioners and academics alike. The findings and insights from this research can be extrapolated to other organizations inBritish Columbia, Canada, and other parts of the world. © 2021 Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In all, 134 parents completed online questionnaires about their 13- to 18-year-old adolescents. Internalized and externalized problems, school functioning, and prosocial behaviors were assessed. Parental perceived stress levels were also measured. Analyses revealed that the mobility rate (i.e., the number of relocations/adolescent age) was not related to youth academic performance, greater suspensions/expulsions from school, or internalized problems. Conversely, mobility rate correlated positively with the presence of externalized problems and negatively with prosocial behaviors. Although these associations were not significant when relocation recency (measured by living in the same community for less than 12 months) was taken into account, they remained a trend, suggesting that adjustment issues were not completely resolved after the transition period. Relocation recency, rather than mobility rate, was a better predictor of adolescent adjustment. Furthermore, parental perceived stress was the variable most associated with adolescent internalized/externalized problems and prosocial behaviors. These results indicate that greater attention should be given to adolescent adjustment in the year following a relocation, because this is the period in which adolescents are at greater risk of developing difficulties. Additionally, the substantial influence of parental stress on youth well-being indicates the importance of services to help parents alleviate their own stress. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The medical course is extremely stimulating but also demanding, and it can interfere with students' mental health. Stress leads to lower life quality, academic performance, and ultimately to a lower quality of patient care delivered. Objective. To analyse stress levels of sixth-year medical students who attend Portuguese colleges. Methodology. This observational cross-sectional study involved Portuguese medical students attending the sixth year of all Portuguese faculties. We applied an online self-response questionnaire, including the 10 items Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to assess stress levels and sociodemographic variables. Logistic regression was used to estimate the weight of the studied determinants on stress levels. Results. A total of 501 participants were included for analysis (69.5% females), with a median age of 24 years old. We found significant levels of stress in 49.9% (95% CI: 45.5-54.3%), with 20.8% of total students presenting extremely high levels, irrespective of age, gender, and faculty. Stress was higher when students presented bad sleeping and eating habits, lack of ability to manage time, dissatisfaction with social life and academic experience, and low family support. Also, these students are more worried about their future and present a higher degree of concern about their graduation test performance. Conclusion. This study found high stress levels among Portuguese medical students, associated with social determinants and the intrinsic complexity of the course. This is worrying, and it elucidates the importance of coping strategies to make students deal with stress and be healthier, currently and in the future.  © 2020 Maria João Oura et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Previous studies on the disorder could not control for important measured and unmeasured confounders. Objective: To prospectively investigate the association between PTSD and objective indicators of educational attainment across the life span, controlling for familial factors shared by full siblings, psychiatric comorbidity, and general cognitive ability. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study included 2244193 individuals born in Sweden between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 1997, who were followed-up until December 31, 2013. Clusters of full siblings were used to account for familial factors. Data analyses were conducted between December 2018 and May 2020. Exposure: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnoses of PTSD in the Swedish National Patient Register. Main Outcomes and Measures: Eligibility to access upper secondary education after finishing compulsory education, finishing upper secondary education, starting a university degree, and finishing a university degree. Results: Of the final cohort of 2244193 individuals (1151414 [51.3%] men) included in the analysis, 1425326 were assessed for finishing compulsory education (919 with PTSD), 2001944 for finishing upper secondary education (2013 with PTSD), and 1796407 and 1356741 for starting and finishing a university degree (2243 and 2254 with PTSD, respectively). Posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with lower odds of achieving each of the educational milestones during the study period, including 82% lower odds of finishing compulsory education (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.18; 95% CI, 0.15-0.20), 87% lower odds of finishing upper secondary education (aOR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.12-0.14), 68% lower odds of starting a university degree (aOR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.28-0.35), and 73% lower odds of finishing a university degree (aOR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.23-0.31). Estimates in the sibling comparison were attenuated (aOR range, 0.22-0.53) but remained statistically significant. Overall, excluding psychiatric comorbidities and adjusting for the successful completion of the previous milestone and general cognitive ability did not statistically significantly alter the magnitude of the associations. Conclusions and Relevance: Posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with educational impairment across the life span, and the associations were not entirely explained by shared familial factors, psychiatric comorbidity, or general cognitive ability. This finding highlights the importance of implementing early trauma-informed interventions in schools and universities to minimize the long-term socioeconomic consequences of academic failure in individuals with PTSD. © 2020 American Medical Association.

This study aims to investigate: (a) 12-month prevalence of BPB among college first-year students, (b) comorbidity patterns of BPB with various mental health problems, and (c) the association of BPB with objective academic functioning. Methods: Using data from the Leuven College Surveys (Belgium), as part of the World Mental Health Surveys International College Student initiative, we cross-sectionally assessed 12-month BPB and mental health problems among college first-year students (n = 4,889; response rate = 73.2%) at the beginning of the academic year. Objective measures of academic functioning (final grades, expressed in academic year percentage “AYP” [0–100%] and academic failure) were obtained from administrative records at the end of the academic year. Results: Twelve-month prevalence of BPB was 7.6% (7.3%binge eating and 1.0%purging), with higher rates among females than males. Bivariate models showed an association between BPB and numerous mental health problems (ORs = 3.4–18.4). Multivariate models showed associations with non-suicidal self-injury, post-traumatic stress, internalizing/externalizing problems and suicidal ideation. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbid mental health problems, BPB were still associated with lower AYP (−4.1 to −11.2% range) and elevated odds of academic year failure (ORs = 1.4–4.2). Conclusions: BPB (especially binge eating) are relatively common and associated with mental health problems, comparatively low academic performance, and higher risk of academic failure among college first-year students. Further study is needed to examine the causal dynamics underlying these associations. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The model posits that higher levels of “overcommitment,” in addition to a high effort–reward imbalance ratio, magnifies this risk of ill-health. While work has been conducted to assess the validity of this model within the school setting, research in the higher education sector is limited. Objectives: This study explored the validity of the effort–reward imbalance model for explaining burnout, poor health, and academic productivity among university students. Design and Methods: This study utilized a cross-sectional survey of Australian university students (n = 395) from a range of universities. Results: An imbalance of effort and reward was associated with poorer physical health, increased burnout, and reduced productivity. Effort–reward imbalance mediated a relationship between overcommitment and burnout; those high in overcommitment were more likely to experience an imbalance of effort and reward at university. Conclusion: The relationships between effort–reward imbalance, health, burnout, and academic productivity support the generalizability of this model to the university setting. In addition, the personal characteristic of overcommitment also appears to have an important relationship with burnout. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study examined sleep quality in pharmacy students in the first (P1), second (P2), and third (P3) professional years during perceived low and high stress periods in a course. Individual sleep and environmental factors were also explored. Methods: This prospective cohort study used an 18-item survey adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) that included demographics, individual sleep components, and factors affecting sleep. Surveys were administered at the beginning of the quarter (low stress) and the week before final exams (high stress). Chi-square tests compared categorical variables; ANOVA/ANCOVA tests compared continuous variables. Results: During high stress, PSQI scores worsened among all classes and was significant for the P3s. Average sleep duration was 6.64 (SD 1.18) and 6.8 (SD 1.18) hours per night for P1s and P3s, respectively, at the beginning of the quarter; both groups had significant reduction in sleep duration at the end of the quarter. There were no significant correlations between PSQI and exam scores. Factors impacting sleep such as exercise, use of technology at bedtime, and work hours outside of school decreased during high times of stress, for P1s, P2s, and P3, respectively. Conclusions: Students demonstrated worsening sleep quality during high stress periods and less sleep than recommended. Academic performance was not adversely affected. Future research should use sleep logs and other performance measures to determine the impact of sleep quality on academic success and wellbeing. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This concept has been of interest to researchers and human scientists in recent years. Quality of work life includes opportunities to solve problems that are mutually beneficial to the employee and the organization and are based on collaboration in management, which can be improved to gradually change the pattern of interaction between people in the organization. Also, proper employee management can be used as a competitive advantage. In addition to affecting many job attitudes, such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and job attachment, work life quality affects individuals' personal, family, and social lives. Accordingly, the present study aims to design and development model for improving the quality of work life of faculty members. The definitions of quality of work life emphasize health promotion, well-being, job security, job satisfaction, competence enhancement, and work-life balance. Studies on the quality of work life indicate the importance of this concept by managers, and advocates of quality of work life are looking for new systems to help employees balance their work life and personal lives. Methods: The present study is descriptive in nature, applied in terms of its objective, and cross-sectional in terms of time. The statistical population of the study includes all full-time faculty members of Islamic Azad University of Behbahan and Khatam Al-Anbia University of Behbahan (N = 195), who were active in the second semester of the academic year of 2018-2019. Sample size is calculated by Cochran formula (n = 129), selected by simple random sampling. A researcher-made questionnaire is used for data collection. In this regard, factors affecting the quality of work life of faculty members are specified through a comprehensive study of articles on the quality of work life as well as the opinion of experts in the field of quality of life and used as the basis of the conceptual model. Considering the literature and the views of experts on factors affecting the promotion of quality of work life, a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting the quality of work life of professors is obtained. In the first step, 143 components are identified. After sorting these factors in terms of thematic similarity, more comprehensive components are selected and minor components are removed. In the next step, the questionnaire is given to 5 academic experts and management experts. After receiving comments, some questions are corrected, merged, or removed. Finally, 57 influential components are identified and categorized into four categories of individual, organizational, managerial, and occupational factors. In the qualitative section, 5 experts are interviewed to ensure face validity. In this regard, the level of difficulty, appropriateness, and relevance of the items to the main purpose and transparency of the meanings of the components are assessed. To determine the face validity coefficient, a 5-point Likert scale is used for each of the 57 items of the tool and the questionnaire is distributed among 15 professors. The item impact factor is calculated, which indicate that all questions are scored above 1.5. In the quantitative section of the content validity, the index of content validity is used. Three criteria of ""relevance, clarity and simplicity"" in a five-point Likert scale are assessed by experts. All items scored above 0.80. The reliability of the questionnaire is calculated by Cronbach's alpha test. The total reliability coefficient of the questionnaire is 0.72. It is 0.73 for personal factors, 0.71 for organizational factors, 0.75 for management factors, and 0.76 for occupational factors. Results: The most important factors affecting the quality of work life of the professors are occupational factors, organizational factors, management factors and individual factors. According to participants, occupational factors affecting the quality of work life of faculty members are workplace mental health (ranked 1), occupational income (ranked 2), occupational security (ranked 3), workplace health and safety (ranked 4), proportion of teaching courses with expertise (ranked 5), required facilities and equipment (ranked 6), professional growth (ranked 7), job independence (ranked 8), teaching (workload) (ranked 9), lack of ambiguity in doing tasks (ranked 10), base (job position) (ranked 11), importance and meaning of work (ranked 12), role clarity (ranked 13), attention to research and innovation (ranked 14), increasing job capabilities and abilities (ranked 15), sharing experiences among colleagues (ranked 16), and job diversity (ranked 17). Organizational factors affecting the quality of work life of faculty members are organizational justice (ranked 1), fair payment and benefits system (ranked 2), on time promotion (ranked 3), intra-organizational communication (ranked 4), clarity of organizational laws and regulations (ranked 5), university development and growth (ranked 6), organizational discipline (ranked 7), interaction and collaboration of professors together (ranked 8), performance evaluation system (ranked 9), payment and benefit stability (ranked 10), organizational trust (ranked 11), organizational facilities (ranked 12), organizational image (ranked 13), flexible organizational structure (ranked 14), and innovative organizational environment (ranked 15). Management factors affecting the quality of work life of faculty members include fair interaction with professors (ranked 1), respect for expertise and professional attitude towards professors (ranked 2), appropriate feedback to professors (ranked 3), peer support of professors (ranked 4), continuous relationship of managers with professors (ranked 5), integrity of managers' behavior with professors (ranked 6), delegation of authority to professors (ranked 7), staff participation in decision making (ranked 8), attention to problems and timely resolution (ranked 9), transparent expectation of professors (ranked 10), using professors' viewpoints in developing organizational goals and policies (ranked 11), supportive supervision (ranked 12), applying system management (ranked 13), and flexibility in decision making (ranked 14). Individual factors affecting the quality of work life include job motivation (ranked 1), adjustment ability (ranked 2), expertise and experience (ranked 3), communication skills (ranked 4), hope and optimism (ranked 5), patience (ranked 6), positive attitude to job (ranked 7), decision making power (ranked 8), self-awareness (ranked 9), self-control (ranked 10), and personal creativity (ranked 11). Conclusion: Designing a model for enhancing the quality of work life of faculty members, and examining and prioritizing the effective individual, organizational, managerial, and occupational factors can guide authorities to improve the quality of work life and organizational health. According to the results, it can be said that the quality of work life of faculty members is one of the most important and effective concepts in higher education organizations and has an interactive nature in the organization, so that organizational policies can positively or negatively affect the quality of work life. According to the participants, job motivation is the first and foremost individual factor affecting the quality of work life of faculty members. Motivation plays a pivotal role in the field of management, both practically and theoretically. Organizational researchers consider it as a cornerstone in developing useful theories about effective management activities, such as the quality of work life. In line with the results, university officials are suggested to develop variables related to professors' job motivation, such as respect, participation in decision making, attention to needs, and trust. Organizational justice is ranked first among organizational factors influencing the quality of professors' work life. In fact, when employees feel that they are working in an organization that does not respect the principles of justice; they are exposed to perceptual and emotional pressures. Therefore, university officials are suggested to consider promoting fair behaviors as a management strategy and more or less promote fair behaviors in the university. Identifying factors that reduce perceptions of organizational justice behaviors among faculty members is one of the main tasks of university managers. In addition, it is suggested to increase the quality of work life by taking into account the sensitivity and complexity of the work and the level of expertise of faculty members, assigning responsibilities based on the level of capability of individuals, and reduce workforce stress by dividing the desired workload, and provide opportunities for growth by evaluating staff performance in terms of expertise, experience, and education. Respondents consider fair interaction to be the first management factors that influence the quality of work life of faculty members. Fair behavior is something that employees are sensitive to and expect its realization when they invest their capabilities in the organization. Therefore, fair dealing with faculty members plays an essential role in promoting and providing mental health and their perception of quality of work life. © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

Method: We surveyed 150 community college students (51% female; Mage = 22.7, SDage = 2.4) with 3 types of immigration statuses: stable (citizen), temporary (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals [DACA] and visa), and at-risk of deportation (undocumented). One-way analyses of covariance examined whether fear of deportation, psychological distress, self-esteem, and academic performance varied across immigration statuses. Regression analyses examined the associations among fear of deportation for self and for family members, depression, and isolation and alienation. Results: Participants with at risk and temporary statuses reported higher fear of deportation for self, fear of family members being deported, psychological distress, and higher self-esteem than those with stable status. Academic performance did not differ across immigration statuses. Within the temporary status, DACA students experienced higher anxiety, isolation, and alienation than other temporary status students. Fear of deportation for self and family members predicted depression and isolation and alienation. Both regression analyses controlled for age, sex, region of origin, hours of work, hours of sleep, and socializing per day. Conclusion: The study provides new insights into how immigration status influences the psychological well-being of community college students and introduces a quantifiable framework to better understand the construct of fear of deportation. © 2019 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. Objective: Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. Methods: We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. Results: Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms. Conclusions: Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college students. © Changwon Son, Sudeep Hegde, Alec Smith, Xiaomei Wang, Farzan Sasangohar.

In children, stress and depression have a detrimental effect on their developmental emotions and physical health. From the perspective of a student, daily stress can affect their learning activities. Hence, to tackle this issue, it is necessary to develop their ability to manage mental health. Self Direction Skills (SDS) can support to develop such an ability. Current wearable devices can acquire physical activity and physiological data to compute stress levels, and sleep quality. While it makes it possible to visualize the amount of stress received in daily life, no such program is linked to the daily learning life of a student. To fill in this gap we extend our earlier developed GOAL system which already synthesizes students' physical activity and learning data and explores possibilities of integrating internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) with our previously proposed DAPER model as an applicable method to deal with daily stress in academic life. We use the wearable devices to automatically track stress levels, and map activities of training students' mental health managing ability to the DAPER phases. Students can make a plan in the GOAL system to reduce stress by selecting a cycle of practice as suggested by iCBT. To inform our system design we conducted a pilot study with 120 students at a junior high school level. This paper presents an exploratory data analysis of 60 students, whose learning performance from english and mathematics courses and stress levels over 133 days were collated. © ICCE 2020 - 28th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.

Due to socialization and independence processes that are part of youth developmental pathways, young people tend to spend more time away from home and on the street, becoming more exposed to violence and thus also contributing to repeated victimization processes. Different studies have shown that distinct situations may promote numerous victimization processes, with a particular impact on the developmental outcomes of youth and causing great suffering. It has been reported that exposure to violence in the community is associated with mental health issues, i.e., post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, poor academic performance, aggressive and antisocial behaviours, alcohol and substance abuse, along with multiple adverse health risk behaviours, suicidal ideation, and also resulting in subsequent homelessness in adulthood. With this review chapter, it is intended to analyse and discuss the impact that CV exposure has on youth, accompanied with practical proposals to prevent it. The concept of CV and the different types of violence and crimes that could be involved are examined, mapping the prevalence of youth affected by this form of violence, analysing the effects of exposure to CV, and concluding with initiatives aimed to contribute to the prevention against this sort of violence, and to minimize the consequences and suffering involved. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

Objective: To determine the levels of stress, depression and anxiety in first-year university students in the health areas, relating them to academic performance. Method: A descriptive, exploratory, non-experimental, cross-sectional design was used. The sample was non-probabilistic of 186 students from a public university in southern Chile, of the health department, which was determined considering a confidence level of 95% and an alpha error of 5%. The abbreviated Chilean version of the DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress scales were applied, consisting of 21 items, with four response alter-natives in a Likert scale format. The research protocol carried out was approved by the Scientific Ethical Committee of the Reloncaví Health Service. Results: The prevalence of these disorders when shown in a grouped way, for the total of the 186 students consulted; 29.00% have some disorder associated with de-pression, 53.20% with anxiety and 47.80% with stress. A statistically significant association was observed between the variables anxiety and academic performance. Conclusions: It can be concluded that there is an association between the academic performance of the students with the anxiety variable, but not with stress and depression disorders. © 2020, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

In a review of 11 articles, Storrie et. al. determined that the number of students with documented MEDs is increasing dramatically [1]. Approximately half of the students involved in the various studies reported that their MED started after they began their undergraduate studies [1]. At our institution we are seeing dramatic increases in the demand for counseling services. A related concern is the prediction of an impending enrollment crisis in higher education. The so-called 'Demographic Cliff' has provided additional motivation to improve retention and graduation rates as the number of college-going students in many states in the United States is expected to decline. We are in the midst of a multi-year study to understand the extent to which our students are experiencing poor mental health and emotional trauma and how this may impact their academic progress. We are particularly interested in student reception to discourses on MED and whether a proactive approach lessens the stigma [1] related to MED with related increases in retention and graduation rates. Background on problem The World Health Organization estimates that 1in 3 first-year college students experience a mental health disorder[2]. In a survey of Canadian college students, Sandhu et al. found that among those affected, there was significant impact on their academic performance with stress (~ 42%), anxiety (~ 33%), and depression (~21 %) being causes of MED related poor academic [3]. While considerable research has been done on undergraduate student wellbeing, very few studies specifically target the impact of MED on engineering students. Foremost among the findings of studies on MED in undergraduate is that stigma related to MED is a barrier to students seeking help [1]. In the design of our program we considered that stigma may be especially acute for engineering students. Many engineers valorize the toughness of engineering programs and celebrate high attrition as a sign that only the best engineering students are making it through [4]. Chew-Graham et al. have found that medical students (a field of study where difficulty in study may also be conflated with rigor) avoid seeking help for MED because they believe acknowledging a mental health issue is a sign of weakness [1,5]. Roberts et al. found that the tendency to forego help for MED is more pronounced for women and racial minorities [1,6]. The existing literature is clear that college students are facing an epidemic of mental health issues. Outside of the decreased quality of life for students, there is an academic cost and a cost to institutions as students fail to achieve their academic goals and often drop out. Intense stress and other comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compromise the cognitive functions critical for learning engineering concepts [7]. These disorders affect students' emotional intelligence, coping strategies for stress, and the ability to successfully complete exams [8]. Student's ability to process information can be slowed down past the rate it is being provided in a classroom setting, resulting in low levels of learning occurring in the classroom [9]. Students with untreated anxiety disorders may not be able to manage a classroom environment or form social relationships with classmates and professors [10]. With so many of the skills and abilities required for collegiate success affected by poor mental health qualify of life (MHQoL), the effect on a student's ability to be successful in the classroom can be profound. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Methods: A 156-item anonymous online survey was distributed via random email generation to a sample of 9449 university students. Current use of alcohol and drugs, psychological and physical status and academic performance were assessed, along with questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity and compulsivity. Positive screens for GD were based upon individuals meeting DSM-5 criteria. Results: A total of 3421 participants (59.7% female) were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of GD was 0.4%, while an additional 8.4% reported subsyndromal symptoms of GD. GD was significantly associated with past-year use of cocaine, heroin/opiate pain medications, sedatives, alcohol and tobacco. Those with GD were more likely to have generalized anxiety, PTSD and compulsive sexual behavior. Questionnaire-based measures revealed higher levels of both compulsivity and impulsivity associated with disordered gambling. Conclusions: Some level of gambling symptomatology is common in young adults and is associated with alcohol and drug use, as well as impulsive and compulsive behaviors. Clinicians should be aware of the presentation of problematic gambling and screen for it in primary care and mental health settings. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Subsequently, there is a steep rise in the prevalence of childhood obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease etc. The impact of obesity or underweight upon a child’s mental health, immediate and future social life is as important as the impact on physical health. So, the need of the hour is to address child’s weight-related problems of being obese or underweight at an early stage of life in connection with their primary care and primary care giver/parents. Aim: To assess the impact of parental stress on body mass index of children within Indian school setting. Method: A sample of 250 students and their parents were contacted personally to obtain information on parental stress scale and body mass index of children. Students with the age range of 10-14 years (grade IV-IX) from three different schools of Jaipur city. Result: The findings of the present study found to be statically significant that there is a difference in parental stress level associated with children’s BMI. Conclusion: Present study paves the way for future studies examine the relationships of parental stress with body mass index of children, as well as BMI on academic performance. The findings suggest that higher level of parental stress leads to higher level of BMI in children which could possibly lead to poor academic performances within a period of middle school aged students. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

For this reason, it is necessary to see to what extent physical activity is related to the academic performance of the students and what might mediate this. A major objective of the study is to explore self-esteem and depression as mediators between physical activity and academic performance. On the basis of informed consent to participate in the study, 358 participants have been selected from Universities in Pakistan, and they were asked about their physical activity, depression during their study and self-esteem through self-report. Participants self-reported their self-esteem, level of depression and their physical activity through standardized measures; the Rosenberg Self-esteem scale (1965), the University stress scale (2016), and the short form of the International Physical Activity questionnaire (2003), respectively. Academic performance had been measured as the cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of the last two consecutive semesters. Self-esteem and depression were found to be significant mediators between physical activity and academic performance. The total effect of physical activity on academic performance was significant but smaller than the total indirect effect through mediators. Though total indirect effect is the combination of the effect of self-esteem and depression, but the larger contribution is of self-esteem which has been found to be the strongest mediator between physical activity and academic performance.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between students' stressful factors and psychological problems (stress, anxiety and depression) among Students at a military medical sciences university in Tehran, Iran. Methods: This study was a descriptive cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 319 subjects from medical, pharmaceutical, nursing and health schools in a Military Medical Sciences University, who were studying at the university during the academic year of 2017-2018. The data gathering tool was a questionnaire. Students Stressors Questionnaire (SSQ) was used to assess the sources of stress in the students and to assess the anxiety, stress and depression, the DASS-21 questionnaire was used. Data were analyzed using descriptive and correlation methods and pathway analysis using SPSS-16 and Amos software. Results: Of the 319 students, 273 (86%) were male and 46 (14%) were female. The mean age of students was 22.32±1.97 years. 22.64% of students had severe to very severe stress, 34.27% had severe to very severe anxiety and 35.65% had severe to very severe depression. Three stressful resources, such as academic conditions, academic environment and graduation stresses had significant relationships (P≤0.05) with stress, anxiety and depression. The stressors of the dormitory environment had a direct relationship with stress and anxiety, but was not found with depression. Conclusion: The existence of direct and indirect relationships between student stressful resources and psychological variables in medical students indicates the importance of controlling the types of psychological stress related resources associated with university education in order to manage mental health of students. © 2019 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

Innate characteristics such as genetic abnormalities, type and severity of CHD and socioeconomic factors are the most important risk factors. Prenatally, hypoperfusion or hypoxia can cause developmental and maturation disorders of the brain, thus promoting postpartum lesions of the more vulnerable brain substance and neurodevelopmental disorders. The high-risk group includes primarily infants requiring open heart surgery. Specific phenotypic characteristics of development emerge at different ages: in early childhood motor and linguistic articulation deficits; at school age impaired speech and language, attention, memory, visual-spatial, executive, and motor skills, often associated with academic deficits, and emotional or social issues; in adolescence executive, psychosocial and psychiatric disorders and impaired quality of life; in adulthood, neurocognitive, psychosocial and problems of self-management and professional perspective. Physical and social functioning, psychomotor development and mental health are key factors for quality of life. The German Society of Pediatric Cardiology demands detailed serial neuropsychological examinations at the age of 2 and 5 years, before puberty and before adulthood, for the high-risk group of children with CHD operated on in infant age in order to detect and to treat partial performance disorders at an early stage. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

This, however, requires independent replication. Hypothesis: There will be no association between AFE to football and behavioral, cognitive, emotional/psychological, and physical functioning in high school and collegiate athletes. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Methods: Active high school and collegiate football players (N = 1802) underwent a comprehensive preseason evaluation on several clinical outcome measures. Demographic and health variables that significantly differed across AFE groups were identified as potential covariates. General linear models (GLMs) with AFE as the independent variable were performed for each clinical outcome variable. Similar GLMs that included identified covariates, with AFE as the predictor, were subsequently performed for each clinical outcome variable. Results: After controlling for covariates of age, concussion history, race, and a diagnosis of ADHD, earlier AFE (<12 vs ≥12 years) did not significantly predict poorer performance on any clinical outcome measures (all P > 0.05). A single statistically significant association between AFE group and somatization score was recorded, with AFE <12 years exhibiting lower levels of somatization. Conclusion: In a large cohort of active high school and collegiate football student-athletes, AFE before the age of 12 years was not associated with worse behavioral, cognitive, psychological, and physical (oculomotor functioning and postural stability) outcomes. Clinical Relevance: The current findings suggest that timing of onset of football exposure does not result in poorer functioning in adolescence and young adults and may contribute to resilience through decreased levels of physically related psychological distress. © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

When children start school, the regulatory mechanisms for controlling visceral functions are still developing, under the influence of which adaptive responses to ambient factors form themselves. Parameters of physical development are reliable markers of adaptive processes. The functional state in children living in the European North of Russia at this age period is influenced by a combined set of specific ecological-climatic conditions and school-related stress exposure. The tong-term studies undertaken by domestic and foreign research teams have so far focused on the effect of this complex set of factors on the morphofunctional development in children, targeting to determine the mechanisms for maintaining physical and mental health in schoolchildren. In this regard to the foreground comes the need of improving school environment in order to increase academic performance and reduce the increasing rates of stress, disadaptation and decompensation of physiological functions in children. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Psychological and yoga interventions have proved to be useful for reducing psychopathological symptoms, and in the development of physical and mental abilities. Objective: To evaluate if psychological interventions based on a Cognitive Behavioral Workshop (CBW) and a Yoga Workshop (YW) diminish depressive, anxiety symptoms and stress in students of the Medicine Faculty at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Method: We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial at the UNAM Medicine Faculty. Sampling type was done in accordance with the students who were retaking at least one of the first or second year curricular subjects. Beck’s inventories for anxiety (BAI) and depression (BDI) and the Novack profile were applied to select those indi-viduals with a mild severity level. Selection of the students was randomized for each one of the interventions. Results: In both interventions there was a reduction of depressive and anxious symptoms (p<0.005). The Cognitive-behavioral workshop group also presented a reduction in the stress manifestations profile, suggesting that they achieved effective stress coping strategies, and managed to visualize stressors as challenges or problems to solve, confront and to focus on the positive aspects of themselves. In the yoga workshop group, there were statistically significant changes in the frequency of ad-equate rest, sleep, and relaxation. Conclusions: It’s important to provide stress management strategies to medical students, in order to promote not only an overall wellness, and as health professionals in promoting healthy lifestyles. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,Facultad de Medicina.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Here we examine junior scientists applying for National Institutes of Health R01 grants. By focusing on proposals fell just below and just above the funding threshold, we compare near-miss with narrow-win applicants, and find that an early-career setback has powerful, opposing effects. On the one hand, it significantly increases attrition, predicting more than a 10% chance of disappearing permanently from the NIH system. Yet, despite an early setback, individuals with near misses systematically outperform those with narrow wins in the longer run. Moreover, this performance advantage seems to go beyond a screening mechanism, suggesting early-career setback appears to cause a performance improvement among those who persevere. Overall, these findings are consistent with the concept that “what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger,” which may have broad implications for identifying, training and nurturing junior scientists. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

It not only affects medical students’ physical and mental health but chronic stress can impair academic performance, personal and professional development, leading to unsatisfactory patient care. The objective of this study is to compare the coping strategies practiced and its association with stress between medical students from a private and public university. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a public and private university namely, University Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniZSA) and UCSI University (UCSI) respectively. A total of 245 medical students from UniZSA and 315 medical students from UCSI, from year 1 to year 5 participated in this study. This study was carried out between 2015 till 2016. A universal sampling method was used. A self-administered questionnaires comprising of 3 sections namely sociodemographic information, 12 item validated General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and a 28 item validated Brief Cope Inventory was used in this study. Data entry and analysis were done using SPSS version 20.0 software. Results: The prevalence of stress was higher (42.2%) among UCSI University medical students compared to University Sultan Zainal Abidin medical students (33.1%). The commonly practised coping strategies in both universities were religion, active coping, acceptance, planning, and positive reframing. The negative coping strategies behavioural disengagement and substance abuse were the least practised in both universities. The associated coping strategies with stress were denial (χ2 5.740; P<0.05 for UniZSA and χ2 13.31; P<0.001 for UCSI), behavioural disengagement; (χ2 19.306; P<0.001 for UniZSA and χ2 7.65; P<0.05 for UCSI) venting (χ2 28.776; P<0.001 for UniZSA and χ2 8.56; P<0.05 for UCSI), and self-blame (χ2 10.700; P<0.001 for UniZSA and χ2 9.94; P<0.05 for UCSI) in both universities, with an additional associated coping strategy; acceptance (χ2 4.277; p<0.05) reported in University Sultan Zainal Abidin. Discussion and conclusion: The stress prevalence was higher among UCSI university students compared to UniZSA medical students. UniZSA medical students practised religion as their highest ranked coping strategy compared to UCSI students who practised active coping. The last 2 ranked coping strategies practised; behavioural disengagement and substance abuse (negative strategies) were similar too. The associated coping strategies with stress were also similar for both universities. Stress management programmes like “Medical Student Well-Being Workshops” should be conducted to further add evidence for the implementation of such interventions for reducing medical student stress. © RJPT All right reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Objective: This study investigates differences in well-being among today's Norwegian medical students compared with students 20 years ago, the most important predictors of well-being today, and whether there have been any changes in the levels of some of these factors since the period analysed. Methods: We analysed cross-sectional survey data among all medical students (63.9%, N = 1044/1635) at two medical faculties with different curriculums (traditional and integrated) in Norway in 2015 (STUDMED 2015). We used comparison data from a longitudinal survey among medical students from the same medical faculties in 1993 to 1999: the NORDOC project (T1 = 89%, T2 = 72% and T3 = 68%). Differences in subjective well-being and correlates by demographic, curriculum, and study environment factors among the present students were tested by t-tests and stepwise linear regression analysis. Results: Students today scored lower on their levels of subjective well-being than students 20 years ago. The difference was found among female and males in different study stages. The final model showed that subjective well-being today was associated with self-esteem (β =.98, p <.001) and social support from medical school friends (β =.22, p <.001), a partner (β =.08, p =.020) or other family members (β =.04, p =.041), as well as perception of medical curriculum and environment (β = -.38, p <.001), personal competence (β = -.40, p <.001), finance/accommodation (β = -.22, p <.001) and perceived exam stress (β = -.26, p <.001). Conclusions: The results show a decrease in subjective well-being among medical students and, in particular, among female students. The faculties should pay attention to the factors identified in the study environment and curriculum associated with subjective well-being in order to promote their student's well-being and stimulate health and academic performance. © 2019 The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

In addition to studies on the prevalence and risk factors, research is needed to better understand the mechanisms by which food insecurity affects students' health and well-being. Objective: To critically explore the experience of food insecurity among college students and its impact on psychosocial health and academic performance. Design: In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with college students to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which food insecurity affects their psychosocial health and academic performance. Participants/setting: Twenty-five undergraduate students from a large public university in California who were recruited from a campus food pantry. Results: Students discussed several themes related to the psychosocial effects of food insecurity: the stress of food insecurity interfering with daily life, a fear of disappointing family, resentment of students in more stable food and financial situations, an inability to develop meaningful social relationships, sadness from reflecting on food insecurity, feeling hopeless or undeserving of help, and frustration directed at the academic institution for not providing enough support. Students also discussed how food insecurity affected their academic performance through physical manifestations of hunger and the mental trade-off between focusing on food and focusing on academics. Conclusion: These findings contribute to the understanding of what it means to experience food insecurity in higher education and can inform how universities support students’ basic needs. © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Therefore, we aimed to identify patterns of adolescent drinking behaviors and factors predicting the distinct subgroups of adolescent drinking behaviors. Methods: We analyzed nationally representative secondary data obtained in 2017. Our final sample included 24,417 Korean adolescents who had consumed at least one glass of alcohol in their lifetime. To investigate patterns of drinking behaviors, we conducted a latent class analysis using nine alcohol-related characteristics, including alcohol consumption levels, solitary drinking, timing of drinking initiation, and negative consequences of drinking. Furthermore, we investigated differences in demographics, mental health status, and characteristics of substance use across the latent classes identified in our study. To do so, we used the PROC LCA with COVARIATES statement in the SAS software. Results: We identified three latent classes of drinking behaviors: current non-drinkers (CND), binge drinkers (BD), and problem drinkers (PD). Compared to the CND class, both BD and PD classes were strongly associated with higher academic year, lower academic performance, higher levels of stress, suicidal ideation, lifetime conventional or electronic cigarette use, and lifetime use of other drugs. Conclusion: Health professionals should develop and implement intervention strategies targeting individual subgroups of drinking behaviors to obtain better outcomes. In particular, health professionals should consider different characteristics across subgroups of adolescent drinking behaviors when developing the interventions, such as poor mental health status and other substance use among binge and problem drinkers. © 2019 Korean Society of Nursing Science.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

These simulations evoke psychophysiological stress in learners which may affect performance. We examined the relationship between stress variables, confidence, and performance during repeated scenarios in clinically-based emergency simulations. Methods: Twenty-six registered nurses completed three simulation scenarios focussing on life-threatening clinical events in a single group pre-test/post-test study design. Trait anxiety was measured at baseline. Visual analogue ratings of anxiety and stress were measured before (‘pre’), recalled ‘during’, and immediately following (‘post’) each simulation scenario, with a self-rating of confidence completed after each simulation scenario. Heart rate was measured continuously throughout the simulation program. Participants self-rated their clinical performance prior to and following the simulation program (‘pre’ and ‘post’). Results: Participants’ trait anxiety was not elevated at baseline (mean: 39.6, SD 6.1). Across the three simulation scenarios, anxiety and stress was elevated ‘during’ simulation compared to ‘pre’ and ‘post’ time points. However, the magnitude of elevation of stress and anxiety during all time points (‘pre’, ‘during’ and ‘post’ simulation) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with progressive simulations. Heart rate increased significantly during all simulations compared to ‘pre’-levels but returned to similar levels following the simulation. The amount of increase in heart rate over progressive simulations was attenuated during simulation 3 compared with 1 and 2 (Sim 1: 103.6 bpm (SD 22.1), Sim 2: 101.9 bpm (SD 18.9), and Sim 3: 99.5 bpm (SD 23.4)). Confidence increased across the three simulations (p < 0.001), with most of the increase observed after the first two simulations. Performance scores increased by 19.0% ‘pre-post’ simulation program (p < 0.001) and were not confounded by previous ALS or simulation experience. Discussion: We observed temporal-dependent changes in psychophysiological stress variables across the simulation scenarios, with decreased magnitudes of elevations of psychological (self-reported anxiety and stress) and physiological (heart rate) stress variables during successive simulation scenarios. This study has shown that simulation increased stress, especially before and during scenarios; however, the learning effect decreased the magnitude of the stress response with repeated simulation scenarios. Simulation educators need to create simulations that change stress in a purposeful manner to enhance learning. © 2019","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Data were retrieved from 49,403 children (13.7 ± 1.6 years old, 48.1% boys) from 12 countries participating in the World Health Organization (WHO) “Health Behaviour in School-aged Children” 2013/2014 study. A validated self-report questionnaire assessed psychological symptoms (feeling low, irritability or bad temper, feeling nervous), school pressure, physical activity (number of days/week 60 min moderate-to-vigorous), screen time, sleep duration on week-and weekend days, and perceived difficulties in getting asleep. Multilevel mediation analyses were conducted. School pressure and screen time were positively associated with psychological symptoms, whereas physical activity was negatively associated. With the exception of sleep duration in the association between physical activity and psychological symptoms, all associations were significantly mediated by sleep duration on week-and weekend days and sleep onset difficulties. Percentages mediated ranged from 0.66% to 34.13%. This study partly explains how school pressure, physical activity, and screen time are related to adolescents’ psychological symptoms. Future interventions improving adolescents’ mental well-being could target schoolwork, physical activity, and screen time, as these behaviours are directly and indirectly (through sleep) related to psychological symptoms. © 2019 by the authors.

Aims: To develop and implement a student support system based on the perceived stress, stressors and coping strategies of physiotherapy students. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was undertaken, using a literature-based, selfcompiled questionnaire and the 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Over a period of three years, 207 third- and fourth-year physiotherapy students at a South African university were included. Results: Psychological distress was experienced by 61.8%–71.2% of participants. During the 3 months prior to the study, 6% of participants received psychological or psychiatric help and 9% of participants used some form of psychiatric medication. The main stressors identified during clinical training were the suffering and death of patients, academic pressure and tension during interaction with personnel. Participants indicated that they mainly coped with these stressors by talking to someone such as a family member or a friend. Conclusions: Based on the findings of this study, a framework to identify and support students in pre-clinical and clinical training years was developed and implemented over five years. This proposed framework might positively contribute to the psychological well-being of health care students. © 2018.

The role of teaching academics in contemporary universities is reported to be in a state of transition, moving from traditional teaching, research and management responsibilities, to more differentiated duties including management of casual staff, accreditation and administration tasks (Bennett, Roberts, Ananthram, & Broughton, 2018; Chory & Offstein, 2017). Stress of heavy workloads, performance demands with fewer resources, expansion of staff roles and expectations, higher research productivity and output expectations are the common neoliberal pressures grounded in commodification and globalising marketisation of knowledge in higher education settings (Field, 2018; Kinman & Wray, 2018). Such examples of neoliberal processes have been well documented, however, Dudau, Kominis, and Szocs (2018, p. 254) contend, although decreasing funding and resources brings pressure, it also invites opportunity for innovation and creativity and ""identifying newer, more effective products or services, using technological advances more effectively, streamlining processes, and so on"". Additionally, for Barnett (2018), contemporary universities are uniquely positioned to embrace possibilities and change. This positioning may encompass cultivating sustainable health-promoting cultures with a focus on promoting high levels of employee mental health and wellbeing through initiatives including enhancing mental health literacy. Therefore, this paper explores the literature in alignment to the research question, 'what are potential enablers of mental health and wellness for those teaching in tertiary education?'. © 2018 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Objective of the study was to rate and analyze the individual anxiety and interference immunity in pneumatic shooting sport. Sampled for the study were the 18-22 year old academic shooters (n=41) from Yakutsk city; 18-25 year-old other highly-skilled (n=16) athletes; and 13-17 year-old trainees of the local CYSS (n=72, including 21 males and 51 females). The sample was tested by the Spielberger Anxiety Test and G. Munsterberger Attention Selectivity and Interference Immunity Test. The study data showed a high meaningful (p≤0.05) correlation between the individual anxiety and interference immunity in the CYSS group and in most of the other groups - that means that the athletes are still in need of special mental/ emotional control trainings - since their emotions were found periodically unstable due to different stresses, fairs and health disorders. It should be emphasized that a growing anxiety undermines the interference tolerance and, hence, the competitive shooting accuracy. It was concluded that timely and regular mental condition rating tests are necessary to identify the athletes most vulnerable to stressors with a special attention to the teenage athletes, and provide an efficient mental self-control training service and support in the individual competitive behavioral model shaping process. © 2019, Teoriya i praktika fizicheskoy kul'tury i sporta.

Design: Combined-group analyses of secondary variables from the MEASUR-UP randomized controlled trial. Setting: Academic medical center. Participants: Obese community-dwelling men and women (N = 67; age ≥60; BMI ≥30) with functional limitations (Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] score of 4-10 out of 12). Intervention: Six-month reduced calorie diet at two protein levels. Measurements: Weight, height, body composition, physical function, medical history, and mental health and quality of life assessments (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]; Profile of Mood States [POMS], Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]; Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]; Satisfaction with Life Scale [SWLS]; and Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]) were acquired at 0, 3 and 6 months. Results: Physical composite quality of life (SF-36) improved significantly at 3 months (β = 6.29, t2,48 = 2.60, p = 0.012) and 6 months (β = 10.03, t2,48 = 4.83, p < 0.001), as did several domains of physical quality of life. Baseline depression symptoms (CES-D and POMS) were found to predict lower amounts of weight loss; higher baseline sleep latency (PSQI) and anger (POMS) predicted less improvement in physical function (SPPB). Conclusion: The significant bi-directional associations found between a weight loss intervention and mental health/quality of life, including substantial improvements in physical quality of life with obesity treatment, indicate the importance of considering mental health and quality of life as part of any weight loss intervention for older adults. © Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Despite attempts to ameliorate mental health challenges at post-secondary institutions, there exists a gap in the evaluation of the specific sources of stress for students within the post-secondary setting. Methods: The goal of this study was to develop a new instrument to better assess the sources of post-secondary student stress. Over the course of two years, the Post-Secondary Student Stressors Index (PSSI) was created in collaboration with post-secondary students as co-developers and subject matter experts. In this study, we used a combination of individual cognitive interviews (n = 11), an online consensus survey modeled after a traditional Delphi method (n = 65), and an online pre- (n = 535) and post-test (n = 350) survey to psychometrically evaluate the PSSI using samples of students from Ontario, Canada. We collected four types of evidence for validity, including: content evidence, response processes evidence, internal structure evidence, and relations to other variables. The test-retest reliability of the instrument was also evaluated. Results: The PSSI demonstrated strong psychometric properties. Content validation and response processes evidence was derived from active student involvement throughout the development and refinement of the tool. Exploratory factor analysis suggested that the structure of the PSSI reflects the internal structure of an index, rather than a scale, as expected. Test-retest reliability of the instrument was comparable to existing, established instruments. Finally, the PSSI demonstrated good relationships with like measures of stress, distress, and resilience, in the hypothesized directions. Conclusions: The PSSI is a 46-item inventory that will allow post-secondary institutions to pinpoint the most severe and frequently occurring stressors on their campus. This knowledge will facilitate appropriate targeting of priority areas, and help institutions to better align their mental health promotion and mental illness prevention programming with the needs of their campus. © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The role of personality in academic success or failure remains poorly understood. Block's personality profile model (Resilients, Overcontrollers, Undercontrollers) has been used to link personality traits to academic performance. The objective of this study is to apply this model to the risk factors of dropping out of higher education courses, including psychological vulnerability, level of autonomy, and the feeling of not being able to keep up. This involved validating Block's profiles in relation to the Big Five personality traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness), and their links with the risk factors for dropping out. Methods: This study is based on a quantitative survey of 196 students (mean age 21.32 years ± 3.11 years, with 63% females) taking higher education courses in France. Three measuring instruments were used: a French scale of Autonomy-situnomy, the French version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI-Fr) for personality traits, and the French version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) for psychiatric morbidity. One item empirically evaluated the feeling of not being able to keep up. Data was processed using a k-average cluster analysis to establish the personality profiles, then by analysis of variance measures to evaluate the differences between them, and Bravais-Pearson correlation coefficient to identify links between risk factors and profiles. Results: Conscientiousness (Control) was the trait most strongly associated with high autonomy and a low feeling of not being able to keep up. There was also a positive influence of Extraversion and Agreeableness on autonomy. On the other hand, Neuroticism scores were related to greater psychiatric morbidity, a greater feeling of not keeping up, and lower autonomy. The results for personality profiles confirm the stability of Block's profiles (Resilients, Overcontrollers and Undercontrollers) and their relevance in higher education contexts. Resilients and Overcontrollers had greater autonomy and a lower feeling of not keeping up, but Resilients had the lowest psychiatric morbidity. Undercontrollers were associated with the greatest risk factors: lowest autonomy, the highest psychiatric morbidity and the strongest feeling of not keeping up. Gender comparisons indicated that women were more affected by psychiatric morbidity, but had higher Conscientiousness and autonomy. © 2018 L'Encéphale, Paris","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

The design of an individual educational trajectory with due account for the individual characteristics of cognitive processes is relevant in modern education. The objective of the study was to organize the students’ cognitive activity in the conditions of the examination load, taking into account the psychophysiological profile as a criterion of health preservation. Materials and methods. The study involved 114 first-year female students aged 17-18 studying at the Faculty of Training Elementary School Teachers of the South Ural State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University in Chelyabinsk. The general sample was randomly differentiated into the main group (Group 1, n=61), for which the program ""Design of Students’ Educational Trajectory Based on the Psychophysiological Profile"" was implemented, and the control group (Group 2, n=53), where traditional tests were performed. The diagnostics of the level of mental performance by the parameters of a simple visual-motor reaction was performed using a hardware-software package ""Biomysh""(Biomouse) (Neurolab, Moscow). The situational and trait anxiety was assessed. The mathematical-statistical analysis was conducted with the use of Microsoft Excel and Statistica v. 7.0. Results. The population of students at the control stage of the study was characterized by an average level of mobility of nervous processes, an optimal speed of the nervous system, a moderate degree of trait and state anxiety. Upon the program completion, the students of the main group noted an increase in the average group indicator of the CNS reaction stability at high values of the reaction stability and reliability of the activity. No significant differences in the mean values of sensorimotor reactions of students in the studied groups have been identified. The indicators of state anxiety had a regular increase in mean values in both groups, but an increase in the mean value of the control group by an indicator of state anxiety was 3.5 times higher than that in the main group. Conclusion. Task scheduling with the use of the program ""Design of Students’ Educational Trajectory Based on the Psychophysiological Profile"" makes it possible to improve academic performance with relatively constant rates of state and trait anxiety, and thus to ensure students’ stable psychoemotional state as one of the conditions for health preservation. © 2018, Pharmainfo Publications.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of depression in individuals living in the UAE. We used a systematic review approach, searching PubMed and Scopus electronic databases to collect studies conducted between 2007 and 2017 on the UAE population (both citizens and expatriates) relating to depression. After evaluating and screening relevant articles, a review of 14 articles was conducted. The prevalence of depression and study populations varied widely across studies with some including students and workers and others limited to those with diabetes. The most common contributing factors were female sex, financial difficulties/ low socioeconomic status, stressful life events, lack of social support, serious or chronic illness (e.g., diabetes, obesity, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis), and a history of eating disorders. Vitamin D deficiency was also highlighted as a risk factor for seasonal depression. Even though previous evidence has promulgated the role of numerous causative factors, the epidemiological studies including risk factors such as personal or family history of depression, low academic performance, and the use of alcohol remain lacking. Further research is needed to identify effective strategies for treating and preventing depression in the future. © 2019, Oman Medical Specialty Board.

This study provided an opportunity to closely examine the potential impacts of workplace and study related stress factors on student’s psychological distress and their academic performance during their first clinical year. Methods: This one-year prospective cohort study was performed at a tertiary hospital based medical school in Melbourne, Australia. Students completed a questionnaire at three time points during the year. The questionnaire included the validated Kessler psychological distress scale (K10) and the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), as well as items about sources of workplace stress. Academic outcome scores were aggregated and correlated with questionnaire results. Results: One hundred and twenty six students participated; 126 (94.7%), 102 (76.7%), and 99 (74.4%) at time points one, two, and three, respectively. 33.1% reported psychological distress at time point one, increasing to 47.4% at time point three. There was no correlation between the K10 scores and academic performance. There was weak negative correlation between the GHQ-28 at time point three and academic performance. Keeping up to date with knowledge, need to do well and fear of negative feedback were the most common workplace stress factors. Conclusions: Poor correlation was noted between psychological distress and academic performance. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Objectives: To investigate the association of atopic dermatitis with stress resilience, cognitive function and educational attainment. Methods: We used data from a national cohort of men who underwent a military conscription examination at ages 17–20 years in Sweden between 1969 and 1976. All potential conscripts met a physician who assessed current or previous history of AD. Stress resilience was measured by a psychologist using a semistructured interview. The conscription assessment included a written cognitive function test. The highest level of education achieved was identified through record linkage. Results: The study population included 234 715 men, 1673 (0·7%) of whom had a diagnosis of AD. AD was associated with a greater risk of low stress resilience [adjusted relative risk ratio (RRR) 1·60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·38–1·86]. AD was associated with higher cognitive function (β-coefficient 0·15, 95% CI 0·05–0·24) and higher educational level (RRR 1·29, 95% CI 1·13–1·47). However, adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics of the family of origin attenuated the magnitude of the associations and eliminated the statistical significance (β-coefficient 0·06, 95% CI −0·03 to 0·15; RRR 1·16, 95% CI 1·00–1·35). Conclusions: Swedish men with AD had lower stress resilience in late adolescence but did not have lower cognitive function or poorer educational attainment. The lower stress resilience associated with AD is consistent with an increased risk of possible long-term adverse health outcomes. © 2018 British Association of Dermatologists","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Thus, we aimed at evaluating anxiety and depression among annual and semester university students of Lahore, Pakistan. A cross-sectional study of 7 months duration was designed by enrolling a total of 404 students from two private and two public sector universities of Lahore. We found significant differences in frequency distribution with regard to age (p = 0.003), marital status (p = 0.01), living status (p = 0.004), and reasons affecting of mental health (p = 0.004) between annual and semester system students. Students enrolled in annual system exhibited higher odds of anxiety, mild (OR 2.7, p = 0.019), and extremely severe (OR 2.6, p = 0.002), compared to semester students. In overall assessment of university students, after univariate analysis, multivariate analysis demonstrated significant association of depression with male students (OR 2.3, p = 0.001), age ≤ 22 years (OR 2.8, p = 0.0005) and living status (OR 5.96, p = 0.0005). Similarly, as for anxiety, only male students demonstrated higher odds of anxiety (OR 2.8, p = 0.0005). As expected, compared to a single reason, multiple reasons affecting student’s mental health demonstrated significant association with all three determinants of mental health, i.e., stress (OR 0.36, p = 0.0005), anxiety (OR 0.31, p = 0.0005), and depression (OR 0.5, p = 0.0005). Taken together, these data suggested higher prevalence of anxiety among annual system students, mainly because of studies, while in overall assessment male students and students at an early stage of their life at the university were susceptible to anxiety and depression, probably due to multiple reasons affecting their mental health. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Knowledge is needed on how this may impact their health and functioning. This study investigates perceived academic performance and school wellbeing in 237 terror-exposed survivors of the Utøya youth camp attack according to their sociodemographic characteristics, health and mental health service (MHS) utilization. Semi-structured interviews were conducted after 4–5 and 14–15 months. The year following the attack, 143 (61%) survivors reported impaired academic performance and 66 (29%) impaired school wellbeing. Female survivors more often reported impaired performance. Non-Norwegian origin, being financially disadvantaged and less social support were associated with impaired wellbeing. Sleep problems, posttraumatic stress, anxiety/depression, somatic symptoms, and lower life satisfaction were associated with both impaired performance and impaired wellbeing. Survivors who had received MHS were more likely to report impaired or improved academic performance and school wellbeing. Higher age and posttraumatic stress reactions were associated with impaired academic performance after multivariate logistic regression adjustments for gender, somatic symptoms and social support. When additionally adjusting for impaired school wellbeing, age and impaired wellbeing were associated with impaired performance. Only posttraumatic stress reactions were associated with impaired wellbeing after similar adjustments. Non-Norwegian origin and being financially disadvantaged were not significantly associated with impaired wellbeing after adjusting for posttraumatic stress reactions, age and gender. Our findings demonstrate how a terrorist attack can considerably deteriorate young survivors’ performance and wellbeing at school, which is associated with poorer health. Consequently, it is important to provide appropriate school support, and coordinate MHS with follow-up at school. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: Survey study of students at three pharmacy schools investigating student stress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10), a two-tiered sources of stress questionnaire and demographic information. Results: Student perceived stress levels were significantly higher than standard populations, but consistent with other pharmacy student populations. The strongest predictor of perceived stress was when students anticipated lower stress levels than actually experienced, followed by pressure to succeed. Additional variables were self-reported grade point average (GPA) and stress from relationships and experiential rotations. For first year (P1) students, having less than a bachelor's degree significantly influenced perceived stress. For the entire sample, male gender and health-related stress were significant. Academic performance (81%) and pressure to succeed (77%) were the most frequently reported general sources of stress. School B students were significantly less likely to report stress about postgraduate opportunities, career choices, and health issues. Students at school C were significantly less likely to report stress about academic issues. Conclusions: Pharmacy students' perceived stress is associated with their expectations, several general stressor categories, and demographic characteristics. Sources of stress appear to differ between pharmacy programs. Programs could examine their policies to see if there were more effective and timely means to address student stress. By better understanding the specific reasons for stress, we may be better able to mitigate its negative effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

We exploit a curriculum reform in China, the implementation of which started in 2004, but rolled out in different years in different provinces. The new curriculum pivoted away from the old lock-step course structure where all students had to take the same courses and only those subjects that were covered in the national university entrance exam were considered important. In contrast, the new curriculum introduced a course credit system, changed textbooks, and provided flexibility in course selection. It also introduced elective courses and made such courses as arts and physical education mandatory, and a graduation requirement. Using survey data on university students and employing a difference-in-difference approach, we find that the students who were exposed to the new curriculum in high school have better academic performance in university. They are happier, and their physical and mental well-being is better. These students are more likely to have positive attitudes towards themselves and they are more involved in student clubs. They have more confidence in their academic ability, they have more positive attitudes towards studying, and they have more general self-confidence. These results indicate that the reform had a significant impact on students’ academic success and well-being, arguably by allowing them to focus on subject matters in which they are interested, and by reducing undue stress of a regimented curriculum. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Methods: A 156-item anonymous online survey was distributed via e-mail to a sample of 9,449 university students. In addition to problematic smartphone usage, current use of alcohol and drugs, psychological and physical status, and academic performance were assessed. Results: A total of 31,425 participants were included in the analysis, of whom 20.1% reported problematic smartphone use. Problematic use of smartphones was associated with lower grade point averages and with alcohol use disorder symptoms. It was also significantly associated with impulsivity (Barratt scale and ADHD) and elevated occurrence of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Finally, those with current problems with smartphone use were significantly more sexually active. Conclusions: Problematic use of smartphones is common and has public health importance due to these demonstrable associations with alcohol use, certain mental health diagnoses (especially ADHD, anxiety, depression, and PTSD), and worse scholastic performance. Clinicians should enquire about excessive smartphone use as it may be associated with a range of mental health issues.

One of the most important and influential factors is sustained stress in and outside of school. Excessive or sustained stress without the mechanisms to manage it properly impacts the brain structures involved in cognition and emotion regulation in a developing brain. As a consequence, academic performance can be diminished and mental disorders are more likely to occur, especially in children and adolescents who have risk factors and socio-environmental determinants for illness. The application of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) with children and adolescents is a newly evolving field, and has become increasingly popular in recent years, both in research and practice. In this chapter, several reviews and meta-analyses are included, which show that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in healthy individuals and for a wide range of stress related and clinical problems. A key feature of contemplative practices is that they represent forms of mental training that cultivate more positive habits of mind by incorporating repetition and practice exercises. Thus, mindfulness is well aligned with the neuroscientific understanding of how new connections are formed in the brain and how regular mental practice influences brain circuits and complex cognitive function. Research exploring the determinants of meditation practice for adolescents can provide school health programs with critical knowledge when developing and implementing future initiatives that promote at-home practice, thus optimizing their effects. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

High levels of anxiety can affect a student's academic performance and also increase the risk of other health-related problems. This study aims to evaluate, thanks to the intensity of stress manifestations (4DSQ) together with the sense of coherence (SOC), the prevalence of TMD and oral parafunctions in students enrolled in the University of Medical Sciences. Moreover, it aims to evaluate the relationship between the psychosocial manifestations of stress and sense of coherence in relation to gender. Materials and Methods: A total of 324 students of Poznań University of Medical Sciences participated in this study. Students were assessed using a three-part questionnaire: one was to assess symptoms of TMD, the second part was 4DSQ, and the third was a SOC Questionnaire. Results: About one-third of the students in this study presented symptoms of TMD and perceived more intensively symptoms of distress, anxiety, somatization, and depression. They presented a higher level of somatic symptoms and a lower level of Sense of Coherence than students without TMD symptoms. Conclusion: There is a strong negative relationship between the sense of coherence and the level of perceived distress, anxiety, somatization, and depression. Female students attending Medical School showed a higher level of somatization of stress but with a higher capacity to overcome challenges as compared to men. © 2019 The Authors.

The authors sought to examine dysfunctional thoughts (maladaptive perfectionism, impostor phenomenon) and negative feelings (shame, embarrassment, inadequacy) that may contribute to poor mental health in pre-clinical medical students. Methods: A survey was administered to first-year medical students at Saint Louis University that included assessments for maladaptive perfectionism, impostor phenomenon, depression, and anxiety, as well as questions about feelings of shame, embarrassment, inadequacy, comparison, and self-worth. Results: A total of 169 students (93%) participated. Students who met criteria for maladaptive perfectionism were significantly more likely to report greater feelings of shame/embarrassment and inadequacy (P < 0.001) than their peers who did not; similar associations were observed in students who reported high/intense levels of impostor phenomenon (P < 0.001). Furthermore, students who reported feelings of shame/embarrassment or inadequacy were significantly more likely to report moderate/severe levels of depression symptoms (P < 0.001) and moderate/high levels of anxiety symptoms (P = 0.001) relative to students who did not report these negative feelings. Conclusions: These preliminary data support a model for how negative thoughts may lead to negative emotions, and depression and anxiety in medical students. The authors propose strategies for preventive interventions in medical school beginning in orientation. Further research is needed to develop targeted interventions to promote student mental health through reduction of cognitive distortions and negative feelings of shame, embarrassment, and inadequacy. © 2019, Academic Psychiatry.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Several studies have indicated medical students have a higher predominance of mental health problems than other student groups of the same age, where medical education acts as a stressor and may lead to unfavorable consequences such as depression, burnout, somatic complaints, decrease in empathy, dismal thoughts about quitting medical school, self harm and suicidal ideation, and poor academic performance. It is imperative to determine the association between important psychoeducational variables and academic performance in the context of medical education to comprehend the response to academic stress. Objective: The aim of this proof-of-concept study is to determine the relationship between resilience, learning approaches, and stress-coping strategies and how they can collectively predict achievement in undergraduate medical students. The following research questions will be addressed: What is the correlation between the psychoeducational variables resilience, learning approaches, and stress-coping strategies? Can academic performance of undergraduate medical students be predicted through the construction of linear relationships between defined variables employing the principles of empirical modeling? Methods: Study population will consist of 234 students registered for the MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) at Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences distributed over 4 cohorts. Newly registered MBBS students will be excluded from the study. Various psychoeducational variables will be assessed using prevalidated questionnaires. For learning approaches assessment, the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students questionnaire will be employed. Resilience and stress-coping strategies will be evaluated using the Wagnild-Young resilience scale and a coping strategies scale derived from Holahan and Moos’s Coping Strategies Scale, respectively. Independent variables (resilience, stress-coping strategies, and learning approaches) will be calculated. Scores will be tested for normality by using the Shapiro-Wilk test. An interitem correlational matrix of the dependent and independent variables to test pairwise correlation will be formed using Pearson bivariate correlation coefficients. Regression models will be used to answer our questions with type II analyses of variance in tests involving multiple predictors. Regression analyses will be checked for homogeneity of variance (Levine test) and normality of residuals and multicollinearity (variance inflation factor). Statistical significance will be set at 5% (alpha=.05). Effect sizes will be estimated with 95% CIs. Results: Psychoeducational instruments in the form of validated questionnaire have been identified in relation to the objectives. These questionnaires have been formatted for integration into Google forms such that they can be electronically distributed to the consenting participants. We submitted the proposal to MBRU institutional review board (IRB) for which exemption has been awarded (application ID: MBRU-IRB-2019-013). There is no funding in place for this study and no anticipated start date. Total duration of the proposed research is 12 months. Conclusions: Psychoeducational instruments used in this study will correlate resilience, stress-coping strategies, and learning approaches to academic performance of undergradudate medical students. To the best of our knowledge, no study exploring the multidimensional association of key psychoeducational variables and academic performance in undergraduate medical students has been pursued. Investigated variables, resilience, learning approaches, and stress-coping strategies, are individual traits, however; students’ learning history before they joined MBRU is unknown, so our research will not be able to address this specific aspect. ©Yajnavalka Banerjee, Aya Akhras, Amar Hassan Khamis, Alawi Alsheikh-Ali, David Davis.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This qualitative study therefore aims to improve our understanding of medical students' perceptions of i) stressors related to their academic studies, ii) resources that may facilitate coping with those stressors and iii) suggestions to potentially reduce stress. Methods: Eight focus groups were conducted with medical students enrolled at a medical school in Germany until thematic saturation was reached. A topic guide was used to facilitate the discussion. Subsequently, focus group discussions were transcribed and content-analyzed using MaxQDA. Results: Organizational factors especially related to inadequate information flow as well as exams (e.g. repeat exams, scheduling, perceived unfair grading), poor theoretical and practical teaching quality, time and performance pressure, social interactions and individual characteristics (e.g. self-expectations, fear of failure) emerged as major contributors to stress. Resources perceived to facilitate coping with those stressors pertained to some other organizational aspects (e.g. flexibility, availability of contact persons), career prospects, practical training, social support, personal characteristics (e.g. knowledge base, past experience) and leisure time. Suggestions for improvement related primarily to organizational measures rather than individual-level measures. Conclusions: Besides well-known stressors (e.g. exams and high performance pressure), some new aspects emerged from our study including stress related to organizational factors and repeat exams. Accordingly, students' wishes for organizational-level interventions, including better information systems and better interweaving of practical and theoretical education, could be first target areas for improvement. © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

A 15-year-old that is undocumented, Black, and labeled an ELL begins to display posttraumatic stress symptoms as she is exposed to racism, sexism, and immigration enforcement practices. Her academic performance begins to drop as she becomes disempowered in her identity and fearful for herself, her family, and her friends. Leaders and counselors at her school are at a loss for tools to help her. This chapter details strategies for school leaders to create a welcoming school environment of mental health equity by a) promoting intergroup contact and ally development, b) providing training to counselors and teachers on competencies for working with undocumented youth, and c) encouraging safe activism/advocacy outlets for students to assemble and speak out against social injustice. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

Evidence from Sudan have reported high figures of adolescent's mental health problems of depression and anxiety. However, studies investigating its association with academic exam stress are lacking. We investigated the prevalence of exam anxiety and depression severity among student setting for Sudan national boarding examination, aiming at identifying possible predictors related to student's socio-demographic and academic status and measuring correlation between exam anxiety and depression severity status among students. Methods: using cross-sectional design, data obtained using standardized west side anxiety scale for measuring test anxiety; and patient's health questionnaire (PHQ9) of nine items for measuring depression was presented in percentages. Association with sociodemographic and academic factors was measured using logistic regression models. Analysis was run at 0.05 level of significance. Results: depression and exam anxiety were found to be highly correlated. The highest fractions of students are those with high levels of test anxiety and moderate to severe depression. Gender, maternal level of education, previous exam experience and academic performance are significant predictor for student's exam anxiety status. Conclusion: high figures of exam anxiety and depression are there among Sudanese students setting for their third years boarding exam. Males, low academic performance and maternal low education are risk factors. School mental health services and programs addressing such group of students are highly demanded in line with more elaborative research efforts in this arena. © Muwada Bashir Awad Bashir et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Holistic stress management interventions equip adolescents with good mental health and improve academic performance. AIM: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of holistic group-based stress management program in reducing academic stress, depression, anxiety, and improving well-being among adolescent girls. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Randomized control trial was adopted and the study was conducted at selected colleges of Dharwad city, Karnataka, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and thirty adolescent girls were randomly selected and assigned to either experimental (n = 115) or control group (n = 115). Both group participants were initially assessed for academic stress, depression, anxiety, general stress, and well-being. The experimental group participants participated in eight sessions of holistic group-based stress management program over a period of 1 month. The intervention comprises of body-mind-spirit strategies focusing on techniques to handle stressful situations, accept responsibility for their own well-being, and take charge of self-health. Control group participants did not receive any intervention. Postintervention assessments were conducted for all the participants on monthly intervals for 6 months. RESULTS: Over 6 months follow-up compared to control group, the experimental group participants showed statistically significant decrease in academic stress (F = 131.60, P < 0.01, n2G= 0.14), depression (F = 156.70, P < 0.01, n2G= 0.13), anxiety (F = 190.50, P < 0.01, n2G= 0.16), general stress (F = 166.10, P < 0.01, n2G= 0.16), and improvement in well-being (F = 156.40, P < 0.01, n2G= 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that holistic stress management program has a positive effect on reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and improving well-being. © 2019 Journal of Education and Health Promotion | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Guided by Critical Race Theory, the authors examined the survey responses of 16 Black men who matriculated at one medical school to assess perceptions of medical school stress. The researchers identified several themes: (1) perceived academic inequities created tension between Black and non-Black medical students but provided bonding opportunities among Black male medical students, (2) stress negatively impacted academic performance and personal health, and (3) use of social support and spirituality contributed to coping and resiliency. For Black male medical students, the general stress of medical school can be compounded by additional race-related stress. Supporting the success of Black male medical students requires understanding perceived stressors, a focus on helping Black men build social and spiritual connections that contribute to resiliency, and active efforts at the organizational level to address perceptions of academic inequity. © 2018, W.

In this cross-sectional study, 230 students answered a questionnaire and instruments to assess CMD (Self Reporting Questionnaire-20), hazardous alcohol consumption (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test), social support (Social Support Scale), perceptions of academic life (Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure), coping (Ways of Coping Inventory) and resilience (Resilience Scale). Bivariate analysis was conducted using the Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney tests. Logistic regression included all explanatory variableswith p<0.20 in the bivariate analysis, besides sex and academic year. The explanatory variables were analyzed in five successive blocks (backward- stepwise), until all variables presented statistical significance in the final model (p<0.05). The prevalence of CMD was 45.2% (95%CI: 38.7±51.6), with no significant differences between sexes. Students with no extracurricular activities, who had negatively selfassessed their health status and their academic performance, were about four times more likely to present CMD, followed by receiving psychological or psychiatric treatment during university (AOR: 2.65; 95%CI: 1.1±6.1) and those with high scores for confrontive coping (AOR: 1.20; 95%CI: 1.0±1.4). Resilience was a protective factor for CMD among dental students (AOR: 0.93; 95%CI: 0.9±1.0). Aspects related to academic performance, health status and confrontive coping strategies were risk factors to students' mental health. Individuals with high levels of resilience showed lower prevalence of CMD.

Sport specialization often requires increased training hours and may predispose young athletes to social isolation, poor academic performance, increased anxiety, greater stress, inadequate sleep, decreased family time, and burnout. Sport specialization frequently introduces multiple stressors that could be expected to adversely affect mental health and function in young athletes and may increase the risk for burnout. This may be confounded by altered sleep duration and quality, increased drive for elite status, and perfectionistic personality types. The signs and symptoms of burnout in young athletes can be difficult to detect.

We hypothesised that medical student debt levels would be negatively correlated with mental health and academic performance, and would influence career direction (ie, medical specialty choice). Design We performed a systematic literature review to identify articles that assessed associations between medical student mental health, academic performance, specialty choice and debt. The databases PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched on 12 April 2017, for combinations of the medical subject headings Medical Student and Debt as search terms. Updates were incorporated on 24 April 2019. Results 678 articles were identified, of which 52 met the inclusion criteria after being reviewed in full text. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA with some from Canada, New Zealand, Scotland and Australia. The most heavily researched aspect was the association between medical student debt and specialty choice, with the majority of studies finding that medical student debt was associated with pursuit of higher paying specialties. In addition, reported levels of financial stress were high among medical students, and correlated with debt. Finally, debt was also shown to be associated with poorer academic performance. Conclusions Medical student debt levels are negatively associated with mental well-being and academic outcomes, and high debt is likely to drive students towards choosing higher paying specialties. Additional prospective studies may be warranted, to better understand how educational debt loads are affecting the well-being, career preparation and career choices of physicians-in-training, which may in turn impact the quality of care provided to their current and future patients. © 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

Purpose: The aim of the current study was to examine the processes by which implicit and explicit stress mindsets relate to health- and performance-related outcomes. Specifically, we propose a stress beliefs model in which somatic responses to stress and coping behaviors mediate the effect of stress mindsets on outcomes. Methods: Undergraduate university students (N = 218, n = 144 females) aged 17-25 years completed measures of stress mindset, physical and psychological wellbeing, perceived stress, perceived somatic responses to stress, proactive behaviors under stress, and an implicit association test assessing an implicit stress mindset. At the end of the semester, students' academic performance was collected from university records. Results: Path analysis indicated significant indirect effects of stress mindset on psychological wellbeing and perceived stress through proactive coping behaviors and perceived somatic symptoms. Stress mindset directly predicted perceived stress and physical wellbeing, and physical wellbeing and academic performance were predicted by stress mindset through perceived somatic symptoms. Implicit stress mindset did not predict proactive behavior as anticipated. Conclusions: Current findings indicate that behaviors with the goal of proactively meeting demands under stress and perceived somatic symptoms are important mediators of the effect of stress mindset on health- and performance-related outcomes. The findings from this study provide formative data that can inform the development of future interventions aiming to encourage more adaptive responses to stress. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2018.

A further aim is to identify the determinants of treatment success. The bibliographic search was carried out using Web of Science, specifically in the categories of “Education and Educational Research” and “Psychology”, obtaining a sample of 122 articles published between 2007 and 2018. Studies were included which had a pre-experimental or quasi-experimental design and included pre-test and post-test phases. Following application of inclusion criteria, 34 articles were selected for inclusion in a meta-analysis of the random effects of each variable. This obtained an average effect size of −0.41 for stress, −0.37 for anxiety, and −0.30 for depression. Three moderating variables were analyzed, with significant correlations being found for the type of treatment relating to stress (Q = 11.01, df = 2, p = 0.004, R2 = 0.294) and depression (Q = 6.14, df = 2, p = 0.048; R2 = 0.436). The stage of education of the individuals was also found to impact upon anxiety intervention success (Q = 13.093 df = 2, p = 0.0009, R2 = 0.196). Interventions mainly addressed the importance of meditation strategies, mindfulness programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in students.

Mental distress among students is a cause of concern as it may impair their behavior and diminish learning, which could negatively affect their academic performance. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and the factors associated with mental distress among college students in Southern Ethiopia. Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 280 regular students of Hawassa College of Health Sciences. Mental distress was measured using a Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). The data were entered into Epi-Info version 3.5.4 and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Multivariable logistic analysis was performed following bivariate analysis to adjust for the effect of confounders. Result: The prevalence of mental distress among the study subjects was found to be 59 (22.30%). Female students were 2.08 times more likely to have mental distress as compared to male students (AOR =2.08 [95% CI: 1.14-3.82]). The odds of mental distress among third-year students was 60% lower compared to second-year students [AOR = 0.40; 95 % CI, (0.19, 0.87)]. Students who were from Amhara ethnic group were 3.37 times more likely to have mental distress as compared to students from Sidama ethnic group [AOR=3.37;95%CI (1.13-10.09)]. Moreover, students who had Grade Point Average of below 60% were 4.69 times more likely to be mentally distressed as compared to those students who scored Grade Point Average of greater or equal to 60% (AOR= 4.69; 95% CI,[ 2.46, 8.96).

This study aimed to assess school adaptation and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms of adolescent survivors five years after the Yushu earthquake. (2) Methods: A large-scale, school-based mental health survey was conducted 5 years after the earthquake among Tibetan students in the city of Yushu using the Adolescent’s School Adaptation Scale (ASAS) and the PTSD Checklist. (3) Results: A total of 1976 questionnaires were collected. A total of 30.7% of Tibetan adolescents had poor school adaptation and 19.5% were estimated as having probable PTSD. Logistic regression showed that females (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60–0.89), senior students (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39–0.59), and those who participated in post-disaster reconstruction (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54–0.85) were less likely to have poor school adaptation, while a positive association was observed among those buried under a collapsed building (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.04–2.09) and those who experienced bereavement (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.27–2.45). Students who had experienced bereavement were also more likely to have PTSD (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.12–2.28). (4) Conclusions: The post-traumatic effects of the Yushu earthquake on Tibetan adolescents were severe and long-lasting. Sustainable long-term mental health services to help adolescents to restructure their mental health are necessary. © 2019 by the authors.

An analysis of students’ needs and of the demand for psychological care is a prerequisite for implementing effective interventions. Method: A total of 706 second-year undergraduate students (MDage = 20.2; SD = 2.73) from all branches of knowledge of the University of Oviedo (Spain) were evaluated by means of standardized instruments. Results: Results showed academic conditions to be the principal stressors and no distinctive behaviour profiles were found according to branch of studies; 44.7% showed levels of emotional distress indicative of anxiety and 13.5% of depression. The situations generating the greatest demand for psychological assistance were fear of speaking in public, requesting help regarding personal problems, distancing oneself from worries and emotions, and the promotion of healthy sleeping and eating habits. Conclusions: The prevention and treatment of psychological problems has consistently been shown to be a factor which enhances academic performance. The needs identified, shared by other university populations, underline the importance of providing specific psychological care in the university context. © 2019 Psicothema.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

It was found that feasibility and acceptability are not frequently examined, though the data available showed that Enhancing Resiliency Amongst Students Experiencing-Stress (ERASE-Stress) and school-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) had high rates of fidelity; and school-based CBT had high levels of acceptability. The review also examined demographic variables and found that U. S.-based research reported racially/ethnically diverse samples, and most samples were from low-income populations. Most studies examined youth exposed to war- and terror-related traumas or natural disaster-related traumas. Additionally, this review provides future directions for research and reveals the need for further research on intervention feasibility and acceptability. A brief description of practice recommendations based on prior research has also been included.

Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 750 students: 512 medical students and 238 non-medical students. All students anonymously completed a socio-demographic survey and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation coefficient or Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: We found a prevalence of 21.5% (n = 161) for anxiety symptoms and 3.7% (n = 28) for depressive symptoms. Being a medical student was more significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety (p = 0.034) compared with other students. Depressive symptoms were slightly associated with poor academic performance (p < 0.01). A percentage of 59.6% (n = 96) of students with anxiety symptoms and 46.4% (n = 13) of students with depressive symptoms did not seek medical or psychological care at that time. Discussion: Medical students in this sample seem to have more symptoms of anxiety, possibly explained by a higher number of female students in that sample. Depressive symptoms could be associated with poor academic performance in both groups, but an evident correlation was not established. Conclusion: Considering the high levels of anxiety symptoms, the possible impact of depressive symptoms in academic performance and the lack of psychiatric or psychological follow-up reported in this study, it is urgent to develop adequate means of support to improve students’ well-being and mental health. © Ordem dos Médicos 2018.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

While there is a robust evidence base on the effectiveness of these programs originating from the US, there is a relative paucity of research on how these programs impact young people in other county contexts, especially for older adolescents and those at higher risk. This study sets out to address this research gap by evaluating the effectiveness of a social emotional learning program designed for older adolescents in Ireland, the MindOut program. MindOut is a universal school-based social and emotional learning program designed for older adolescents in Ireland which was developed based on a common elements approach underpinned by CASEL’s framework. Employing a cluster randomized-controlled trial, data on social and emotional skills, academic performance and mental health outcomes were collected from students (n = 497; 51.1% female) ages 15–18 years in 32 disadvantaged schools. There were significant improvements in intervention students’ social and emotional skills including, reduced suppression of emotions (p = 0.035), use of more positive coping strategies [reduced avoidance coping p = < 0.001) and increased social support coping p = 0.044)]. Improvements in mental health and wellbeing were also found with significantly reduced levels of stress (p = 0.017) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.030) as well as reduced anxiety scores for females students (p = 0.044). These short-term evaluation findings support the positive impact of school-based social and emotional learning programs, such as MindOut, when designed to be both age and culturally appropriate and delivered to older adolescents in disadvantaged schools. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Methods Data were collected in two months and 12 months after delaying school time, each using self-administered questionnaires for 238 students at a middle school in Gyeonggi province. Questionnaires consisted of demographic data and various sleep and emotion related scales, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Students were divided into two groups, of increased or decreased total sleep time (TST). Results In both groups, sleep duration, global PSQI score, and sleep efficiency significantly improved in 12 months, compared to two months' data. There was significant improvement in depression, stress, behavioral aggression, and verbal aggression in the increased TST group. The increased TST group showed advancement in subjective feeling of happiness, and number of times students are late for school, between baseline and 12 months. The decreased TST group showed significant differences between baseline and 12 months in seven categories of subjective life quality/ emotions in school, including subjective feeling of happiness, concentrating in classes, and anger. Conclusions After school start time was delayed, many adolescent's TST relatively decreased on school nights. However, students whose TST increased, showed reduction in depression, stress, and behavioral/verbal aggression. Students whose TST decreased also reported reduced negative affect, and significant improvement in subjective emotions and school performance. Delaying school start time may be beneficial, in improving mental health and quality of life of students. © 2019 The Korean Society of Sleep Medicine.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

OBJECTIVE To explore potential benefits to stress, cognition, and performance in postgraduate year 1 (PGY-1) surgery residents receiving modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (modMBSR). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This follow-up study is an analysis of the Mindful Surgeon pilot randomized clinical trial of modMBSR (n = 12) vs an active control (n = 9), evaluated at baseline (T1), postintervention (T2), and 1 year (T3), took place at an academic medical center residency training program among PGY-1 surgery residents. Data were collected between June 2016 and June 2017 and analyzed from June 2017 to December 2017. INTERVENTIONS Weekly 2-hour modMBSR classes and 20 minutes of daily home practice during an 8-week period vs an active control (different content, same structure). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Preliminary evidence of efficacy was explored, primarily focusing on perceived stress and executive function and secondarily on burnout, depression, motor skill performance, and changes in blood oxygen level-dependent functional neuroimaging during an emotion regulation task. Group mean scores were calculated at T1, T2, and T3 and in linear mixedeffects multivariate analysis. Effect size for analysis of covariance is presented as partial η2 with the following cutoff points: Small, less than 0.06; medium, 0.06 to 0.14; large, greater than 0.14. RESULTS Postgraduate year 1 surgery residents (N = 21; 8 [38%] women) were randomized to a modMBSR arm (n = 12) or an active control arm (n = 9). Linear mixed-effects modeling revealed differences at T2 and T3 in perceived stress (mean [SD] difference at T2: ModMBSR, 1.42 [5.74]; control, 3.44 [6.71]; η2 = 0.07; mean [SD] difference at T3: ModMBSR, 1.00 [4.18]; control, 1.33 [4.69]; η2 = 0.09) and in mindfulness (mean [SD] difference at T2: ModMBSR, 3.08 [3.63]; control, 1.56 [4.28]; η2 = 0.13; mean [SD] difference at T3: ModMBSR, 2.17 [3.66]; control, -0.11 [6.19]; η2 = 0.15). Burnout at T2 (mean [SD] difference: ModMBSR, 4.50 [9.08]; control, 3.44 [6.71]; η2 = 0.01) and T3 (mean [SD] difference: ModMBSR, 5.50 [9.96]; control, 5.56 [9.69]; η2 = 0.01) showed similar increase in both groups.Working memory increased more at T2 in the modMBSR arm (mean [SD] difference, 0.35 [0.60]) than in the control arm (mean [SD] difference, 0.21 [0.74]; η2 = 0.02) and at T3 (modMBSR, 0.68 [0.69]; control, 0.26 [0.58]; η2 = 0.20). Cognitive control decreased more in the control arm at T2 (mean [SD] difference at T2: ModMBSR, 0.15 [0.40]; control, -0.07 [0.32]; η2 = 0.13) and at T3 (mean [SD] difference: ModMBSR, 0.07 [0.59]; control, -0.26[0.53]; η2 = 0.16). Mean (SD) circle-cutting time improved more at T2 in the modMBSR arm (-24.08 [63.00] seconds) than in the control arm (-4.22 [112.94] seconds; η2 = 0.23) and at T3 in the modMBSR arm (-4.83 [77.94] seconds) than in the control arm (11.67 [145.17] seconds; η2 = 0.13). Blood oxygen level-dependent functional neuroimaging during an emotional regulation task showed unique postintervention activity in the modMBSR arm in areas associated with executive function control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and self-awareness (precuneus). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this pilot randomized clinical trial, modMBSR in PGY-1 surgery residents showed potential benefits to well-being and executive function, suggesting a powerful role for mindfulness-based cognitive training to support resident well-being and performance, as mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. © 2019 JAMA Network Open.All right reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

A 156-item anonymous online survey was distributed via email to a randomly chosen subset of 10,000 university students, at a large public university. The survey queried current use of alcohol and drugs, psychological and physical status, academic performance, sexual behaviors, and questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity and compulsivity. A total of 3,459 participants (59.1% female) completed the survey and were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of BDD was 1.7% (n = 59). Compared to students without BDD, those with BDD were significantly more likely to endorse symptoms of compulsive sexual behavior, depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Questionnaire-based measures revealed higher levels of both compulsivity and impulsivity associated with BDD. BDD appears to be common in young adults, and is associated with specific mental health comorbidities, as well as both impulsive and compulsive traits.

There are some studies on which measures are more effective to reduce stress in Nursing assistant students. There are no studies that link SOC with the two key aspects in the prevention of stress in Nursing assistant students: the motivation of pursuing this profession and the academic level. Objectives: To explore the salutogenic paradigm among Nursing assistant students in a region of Spain (Comunitat Valenciana). Design: Cross-sectional, analytical and exploratory study carried out in 2016. Methods: Students of the first year of Nursing Assistant certification. Self-administered questionnaire to collect the variables: Sense of Coherence (SOC-13 instrument); professional vocation; Self-reported grades of the academic record. Results: The mean score for the total SOC measurement was M = 56.38 (SD = 12.236; 71). Regarding the SOC components, the average score was for Manageability M = 16.45 (SD = 4.53; 24); Comprehensibility M = 19.27 (SD = 5.642; 30)and Meaningfulness M = 20.65 (SD = 4.48; 23). Students who lived in rural environments presented a weaker SOC (M = 54.05), compared to those who were located in urban environments (M = 56.83)and large cities (M = 56.15). The students who reported a choice of studies motivated by professional vocation presented a stronger SOC, scoring also a remarkable academic performance (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Strong levels of SOC in Nursing assistant students, are related to a greater motivation to study something desirable, and to obtaining high academic performance, despite being a demanding and high-stress profession. Therefore, a strong SOC seems to contribute to being more resistant to stress. The environments that provide and facilitate greater external resources such as health, education, culture, association, leisure and recreation, for the community, have higher global levels of sense of coherence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Previous research focused on distinguishing between truancy and anxiety-driven school refusal, but current policy has shifted to reducing absenteeism for any reason. Chronic absenteeism appears to be driven by overlapping medical, individual, family, and social factors, including chronic illness, mental health conditions, bullying, perceived lack of safety, health problems or needs of other family members, inconsistent parenting, poor school climate, economic disadvantage, and unreliable transportation. Family physicians are well positioned to identify patients with frequent absences, intervene early, and tailor treatment plans to the patient’s medical and social needs. Informing parents of the link between school attendance and achievement can be effective in reducing absences. If absenteeism is caused by chronic illness, management should include clear expectations about school attendance and care coordination with school personnel. Mental health conditions that interfere with school attendance can often be treated with cognitive behavior therapy and/or pharmacotherapy. When assessing a child with frequent absences, physicians should inquire about bullying, even if the patient is not known to identify with a vulnerable group. Families and schools are key collaborators in interventions via parent education, parental mental health treatment, and school-based intervention programs. © 2018 American Academy of Family Physicians.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This stress causes problems ranging from academic difficulties and poor performance, to serious mental and physical health issues. Studies have shown that physical activity can help reduce stress, improve academic performance and contribute to a healthier campus atmosphere physically, mentally, and emotionally. Computer science is often considered among the most difficult and stressful programs offered at academic institutions. Yet the current stereotype of computer scientists includes unhealthy lifestyle choices and de-emphasizes physical activity. This paper analyzes the effects of introducing short periods of physical activity into an introductory CS course, during the normal lecture break. Contrary to the stereotype of CS students, participation was high, and the students enjoyed these Fit-Breaks more than alternative break activities. This small injection of physical activity also had a measurable impact on the students’ overall satisfaction with life, and may have had positive impacts on stress, retention, and academic performance as well as improved student perception, especially in areas that are traditionally problematic for female computer science students. Fit-Breaks are low-cost, easy to replicate, and enjoyable exercises. Instead of sitting quietly for ten minutes staring at a phone; stretching, moving, and getting a short burst of physical activity has a positive benefit for students. And the good news is: they actually enjoy it. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

One approach to stress prevention that has seen a surge in implementation is the use of university-based Animal Visitation Programs (AVPs). Despite their popularity and promising causal findings, program evaluations on students’ responsiveness (e.g., enjoyment, attendance, perceptions on usefulness and behavioral change) have yet to be conducted. Using a mixed methods approach, this study reports results of a program evaluation embedded in a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of incorporating various levels (0%, 50% or 100%) of Human Animal Interaction (HAI) into a four-week long university-based stress prevention program resulting in three conditions: (1) Evidence-based Academic Stress Management content only (0% HAI), (2) Human Animal Interaction with therapy dogs only (100% HAI) and (3) equal combinations of Academic Stress Management and HAI (50% HAI). Responsiveness (e.g., enjoyment, usefulness, recommendation and behavioral change) was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively using self-reported survey data collected immediately following the program and again six weeks later. The results suggest that combining evidence-based content presentations with HAI was associated with higher levels of enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and likelihood of recommendation compared to presenting content presentation or HAI alone, although doing so did not result in differences in perceived behavioral change by condition. Themes of students’ perceptions on the role of HAI in shaping program enjoyment, usefulness, recommendations and behavioral change were described. © 2019 by the authors.

Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is a multidimensional construct that encompasses physical functioning as well as psychosocial aspects of emotional and social functioning. This study explored factors related to HRQoL in Asian pediatric patients with leukemia in Singapore. The available variables included: Age, treatment duration, household income, gender, ethnicity, religion, diagnosis, and phase of treatment. It is hypothesized that the relationships will be significant. In the current study, there were 60 patients (60% males) with leukemia; their ages ranged from 1 to 21 years (Mean = 8.03, Standard Deviation = 4.55). The hypothesis was partially supported. Age had a significant positive relationship with physical functioning, r(60) = 0.28, p < 0.05, physical health, r(60) = 0.28, p < 0.05, and the total HRQoL score, r(60) = 0.29, p < 0.05. Treatment duration had a positive relationship with school functioning, r(60) = 0.28, p < 0.05. All other correlations were statistically non-significant. The effects of the available psychosocial variables of gender, ethnicity, and religion were examined on scores from the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Ethnicity had a significant effect on social functioning, U = 292.00, p < 0.05, r = 0.3 (medium effect size). Specifically, Chinese (Median = 85.00, n = 33) had significantly higher scores on social functioning than others (Median = 70.00, n = 27). The remaining comparisons were statistically non-significant. The current findings added to QoL research, and provided an impetus for more research in the area of HRQoL for children with leukemia in Singapore. © 2019 by the authors.

To meet such a challenge adequately, individuals not only have to activate their mental and physical resources, but they also have to disengage from the task and recover once the challenge has been met. How students experience these situations depends in part on how they recover from the stress, and this has putative impact on their longer-term academic well-being. Methods: In a sample of 68 university students, the present study investigated the impact of four dimensions of students’ academic self-concept on how efficiently students recovered after a challenging presentation in a university seminar. Recovery was assessed using psychophysiological measures; heart rate and heart rate variability were investigated. Higher levels of students’ social self-concept (self-concept depending on social comparison) were linked to poorer recovery from the challenge, whereas higher levels of absolute self-concept (independent of external criteria) were associated with more efficient recovery. Results: The findings suggest that a focus on one’s own abilities (ie, internal performance standard) is linked to more adaptive patterns of responses to challenging situations, while the focus on social comparisons seems to hamper adaptive coping with academic stress. Conclusion: These findings have consequences not only for learning and instruction but also for students’ health and well-being. © 2019 Wimmer et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Many medical students suffer from psychological stress which may lead to burnout and poor academic performances. Quality of life (QOL) of medical students is also affected. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression of the senior medical students and to assess their QOL. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study which involved medical students in their final two years of study at a public university in Malaysia. Self-administered Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and World Health Organisation QOL questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) were used to assess their psychological symptoms and QOL. Results: A total 149 students participated. The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression were 33% and 11% respectively. Malay students had significantly more anxiety compared to the other ethnic groups, P<0.05. Female students had significantly lower psychological score compared to male; 70.73 vs 66.32(P<0.05). Anxiety and depression were associated with significantly poorer QOL. Students with depression symptoms were associated with lower physical, psychological and environmental domain score whereas those with anxiety had lower psychological, social and environmental scores, P<0.05. Overall QOL score was significantly lower in Chinese students (P<0.05) and those with depression (P<0.001). Conclusion: QOL of medical students are significantly affected by the presence of anxiety and depression. It is recommended that medical schools implement measures which can identify students at risk and to offer comprehensive intervention and preventive programmes to improve the students’ wellbeing. © 2019, Malaysian Medical Association.

Using Therapeutic Touch and other subtle energy interactions, the students also cited improved interpersonal relationships, increased feelings of calmness, a higher degree of self-awareness and self-care, reduced physical pain, increased energy, and greater appreciation of the world around them. The theoretical framework was Margret Neuman’s theory of health as expanding consciousness. While this is an elective nursing course, the nursing students were primarily juniors and seniors already taking clinical courses. A research study with a wide sample of student participants, especially freshmen, and using quantitative as well as qualitative measures would be beneficial to determine if such a course should be part of the standard nursing curriculum to not only expand nurses’ understanding of complementary and alternative therapies but also to help students with their own self-care and influence their practice as clinicians. © The Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Despite evidence that anxiety in the context of school is associated with significant school-related disability, no studies have examined specific aspects of school anxiety in a pediatric chronic pain population.Materials and Methods:Adolescents with chronic pain (n=30) and age-matched and sex-matched controls (n=30) and their parents completed questionnaires assessing school anxiety and functioning.Results:Adolescents with chronic pain reported significantly more cognitive, behavioral, and psychophysiological symptoms of school anxiety relative to healthy controls. Youth with pain also endorsed significantly greater school anxiety in situations involving negative social evaluation and peer aggression. Exploratory analyses indicated that adolescents with chronic pain reporting school refusal behaviors more strongly endorsed behavioral and psychophysiological school anxiety symptoms, and more symptoms in social-evaluative situations. Youth with pain reporting lower school functioning endorsed more cognitive school anxiety symptoms and anxiety in situations involving academic failure relative to those reporting higher functioning.Discussion:Present results offer a nuanced perspective into the underlying sources of school anxiety among adolescents with chronic pain. Our findings may inform future research efforts and targeted school functioning interventions. In particular, findings suggest that an individualized approach to the assessment of school anxiety which considers the unique sources of anxiety (eg, social vs. academic) may lay the groundwork for the refinement of school functioning interventions in pediatric chronic pain. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, few studies have examined how Black engineering and computing doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers experience these challenges and stressors or focused on the psychological effects, behavioral responses, or health costs for these students. We interviewed 48 Black PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in engineering and computing departments to find out how they describe, make sense of, and cope with stressors and strains in their training programs. Study participants (29 men and 19 women) ranged from first-year doctoral students to recent PhDs. Students attended various institutions and institution types, primarily in eastern and central time zones. Nine participants attended historically Black colleges and universities, and though we anticipated that their experiences would be vastly different, their experiences closely resembled those of students in other institutions. Research Design: Each person participated in either an individual interview or focus group. Data were collected via video- and audio-recording. All focus groups took place at either a national engineering-/computing-related conference or at the students' home institutions. Twentythree participants were interviewed, while the remainder participated in focus groups of three to five students (maximum of ten). Interviews and focus groups were semistructured, using openended questions but allowing some flexibility to develop new ideas and order topics differently. Data Collection and Analysis: This study employed transcendental phenomenology, using three steps to investigate and make meaning of participants' experiences: examining the phenomenon with intentionality, eidetic reduction, and constitution of meaning. Transcendental reduction allowed for examining the experience of Black doctoral students in engineering and computing in general and separating what the research perspectives supplied from what our intuitions offered, guided by our theoretical frameworks of role strain and racial battle fatigue. Transcendental phenomenology also gave the authors a context to examine and disclose our own experiences and feelings. Findings: Consistent with prior research on role strain and John Henryism (i.e., trying to overcome a chronic stressor by working harder), we found that seeking success in training, employment, work, or career was more important to these Black graduate students and postdocs than safeguarding their mental or physical health. Meeting the demands of a PhD program or postdoctoral fellowship were critical priorities congruent with their phase of life. Their focus and sacrifice may have helped them complete their degrees, but our findings suggest that these strategies exacted psychological, emotional, and physical costs. The study deepened our understanding of significant interrelated dynamics for this population in four key ways. We found that (a) the stresses and strains made students question their qualifications; (b) racialized experiences were often the source of stress, strain, and academic performance anxiety; (c) discordance between the racial make-up of their academic environments and their racialized engineering and computing identities appeared to exacerbate impostor phenomenon; and (d) the students' proactive coping mechanisms took an emotional toll. Participants discussed the nature and sources of their feelings of self-doubt. The implications extend beyond the dwindling numbers of Black students earning STEM doctorates; this racial climate also affects the academic workforce and the professional landscape. Although Black researchers who leave academia after completing doctoral training can influence scientific innovation through other positions, it is alarming and problematic that potentially qualified future professors are dissuaded from pursuing academic careers because of their training experiences. Their absence from faculty can hinder critical innovation, breakthroughs, and the training of succeeding generations of scholars who might have learned from and collaborated with them. Conclusions and Recommendations: The added stress, strain, and toll on Black students' well-being is an underappreciated reason for their relinquishing of academic careers. Our findings illustrate the students' resilience and strength. Continued research on added stressors (e.g., impostor syndrome, racialized stress) and strengths could add much-needed consideration of cultural, structural, and interpersonal racism and the ways that Black students earning doctoral degrees in STEM fields manage to succeed despite cultural and institutional barriers. Future research should explore how to modify the microculture of STEM programs and departments to allow Black students to feel that these are healthy, safe, and fair spaces in which they can make contributions. Otherwise, an invaluable diversity of perspectives may disappear altogether from academic environments. In addition, diversifying the faculty and students in doctoral engineering and computing programs could help to reduce impostor syndrome, isolation, and other damaging psychological stress. Forthcoming research, programs, and policies should consider what Black students in STEM endure, because simply surviving racially toxic environments should not be the end goal. © by Teachers College, Columbia University.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, it is unclear whether these gender differences are also relevant to understanding another key marker of adolescent maladjustment: high school dropout. A state-of-the-art interview protocol was used to assess recent SLE in a sample of academically vulnerable Canadian adolescents (N = 545, 52% boys). The sample was comprised of three groups in approximately equal proportions: 1) students who had recently dropped out; 2) matched students at risk of dropping out but who persevered nevertheless; and 3) “normative” students with an average level of risk. When SLE of all types were considered together, overall exposure was similar for adolescent boys and girls, and the SLE-dropout association did not vary as a function of gender. However, gender differences emerged for specific events. Boys were especially exposed to SLE related to performance (e.g., school failure, suspension) and conflicts with authority figures (e.g., with teachers or the police), whereas girls were particularly exposed to SLE involving relationship problems with family members, peers, or romantic partners. In terms of specific SLE-dropout associations, one consistent result emerged, showing that performance/authority-related SLE were significantly associated with dropout only among boys. It therefore seems that considering gendered exposure and sensitivity to SLE is important for understanding the emergence of educational difficulties with long-ranging consequences for future health and well-being. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

As a chronic work stress, workplace bullying places the victims' physical and mental health at risk which, in extreme cases, may lead to suicidal ideation. The high prevalence rate of workplace bullying has been reported and documented globally. However, a major limitation of the existing literature is that studies essentially focus on the consequences of workplace bullying on victims, including the psychological, physiological and socioeconomic impacts, and on the factors causing workplace bullying, but research on the impact of workplace bullying on the victims' families is lacking. It is however evident that the consequences of workplace bullying have a spillover effect on the victims' family members. Since many victims have children and given that children are particularly vulnerable to a negative family environment, examining the impacts of the type of parental stress induced by workplace bullying on children's health including physical and psychological health (depression and self-esteem), externalizing problem behaviors (aggression, lying, disrespect) and school adjustment (academic performance and school conduct) is urgently needed. The overall aim of this study is to examine how health, externalizing problem behaviors and school adjustment of children whose parents are victims of workplace bullying may be associated with the impact that workplace bullying has on parenting practices. Methods: It is a longitudinal study. Quantitative data will be collected from multi-informants, including currently employed Chinese parents, their children aged between 6 and 12 years old, and their class teachers at two time points, separated by a 1-year interval. One primary school will be recruited from each district of Hong Kong including participants with different socioeconomic backgrounds. At least 837 dyads (parents and children) from 18 primary schools will join the study. Discussion: Workplace bullying not only affects victims but can also be harmful to their families as it alters the victims temper in the family environment. Results will be informative for the government and corporations to make concerted efforts and find strategies to prevent workplace bullying and to heighten the awareness of the importance of promoting safe and respectful workplaces for workers. © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This article analyzes the effect of eudaimonic well-being on the use of adaptive strategies for coping with academic stress. Moreover, it analyzes the role of self-efficacy as a mediator and moderator of this relationship. In the mediation model, gender is included as a co-variable; in the moderation model, gender is included as a moderator. A total of 1402 university students participated in the study. The data were gathered through validated self-report instruments. The mediation analyses were performed using the PROCESS module of the statistical package, SPSS. The moderating effects of self-efficacy and gender were analyzed through hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicate that self-efficacy partially mediates but does not moderate the relationship between eudaimonic well-being and adaptive coping strategies.

In the long-term (19 days) and short-term (7 days) chewing gum groups, the pretest scores of depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly higher than the posttest scores. Although the posttest scores on the self-focused attention subscale were higher than the pretest scores in long-term chewing gum group, there was no significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores in this group. The academic success mean scores of the long-term experimental group students were higher than those of the other groups.

A theoretical Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was proposed and the estimated model was obtained applying the Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach. Based on the PLS-SEM path coefficients, the latent construct behavioural stress has a direct effect on distress and insecurity, and an indirect effect on both quantitative demands and academic burnout.

School bullying can cause serious consequences among adolescents, including psychosocial problems, low self-esteem and post-traumatic stress disorder. Most studies examining the associations between being bullied in school and suicide are from Western, developed countries. Moreover, few studies focus on being threatened or injured with a weapon, which may cause serious body injury. Our study aimed to explore the relationship of being threatened or injured with a weapon in school with suicidal ideation and attempt among middle and high school students in Zhejiang Province, China. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 23,543 students in grades 7-12 from 442 schools was carried out through an anonymous self-administered questionnaire between April and May 2017. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship of being threatened or injured with a weapon in school with suicidal ideation and attempt. Results: 51.3% of participants were boys, and mean (SD) age was 15.6 (1.7) years. The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt were 16.1% (95%CI: 15.3-16.9) and 3.6% (95%CI: 3.3-4.0), respectively. Prevalence was higher among girls than boys (ideation: 19.1% vs. 13.3%. attempt: 4.4% vs. 2.9%). 13.2% of students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon in school in the past 12 months (95%CI: 11.9-14.5), higher among boys than girls (15.7% vs. 10.5%), and among rural students than urban students (13.9% vs. 11.6%). After adjustment for socio-demographic status, lifestyle factors, academic performance, self-reported health and mental health, the odds ratios for suicidal ideation and attempt among students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon were 1.46 (1.31-1.61) and 1.68 (1.31-2.13) respectively, as compared with those who did not report being threatened or injured. Conclusions: Preventive measures for physical bullying in school need to be reinforced in China. Being threatened or injured with a weapon is associated with both suicidal ideation and attempt among middle and high school students. Suicide prevention should be an important component of psychological interventions for threatened or injured students. © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Using data from the 2015 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, we identified the major stressors among Korean adolescents based on gender, current educational level, residential area, and socioeconomic status (SES). The major stressors among girls were relationship-and appraisal-related factors, whereas boys more often reported health-and conflict-related factors. High school students more often reported academic performance and family circumstances as major stressors, whereas middle school students tended to report conflict-related factors. Urban adolescents reported academic performance and conflicts with parents as major stressors while rural adolescents reported conflicts with teachers and peer relationship problems. Finally, adolescents of lower SES reported multiple factors, including relational and family problems, as major stressors; contrarily, among those of higher SES, the primary stressor was uniquely related to academic performance. This result is significant in that adolescents’ stress levels, as well as the types of major stressors, vary depending on individual factors. It could also be beneficial for developing and implementing individualized and thus more efficient stress-management strategies. © 2018 by the authors.

Methods: In a survey of patients at an academic center and a Veterans Affairs hospital, we asked individuals with multiple chronic conditions to identify their most bothersome chronic condition and describe why it is challenging. Standard content analysis methods were used to code responses and identify themes reflecting characteristics of most bothersome conditions. Results: The most commonly cited bothersome conditions were chronic pain (52%), diabetes (43%), post-traumatic stress disorder (25%), heart failure (24%), and lung problems (20%). Conditions were described as most bothersome due to: (a) impact on function and quality of life (e.g. active symptoms, activity limitations), (b) health consequences or sequelae (e.g. risk of complications), and (c) challenges associated with treatment or self-management. Patterns of theme dominance varied for conditions with different characteristics. Discussion: The conditions that patients with multiple chronic conditions identify as most bothersome vary depending on individuals’ diseases and their health-related preferences and priorities. Ascertaining patients’ most bothersome conditions and associated challenges, stress, and frustrations may help ensure that management decisions are aligned with patient preferences and priorities. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Such difficulties can lead to several negative outcomes, including poor academic performance, sub-optimal mental health, reduced study satisfaction, and dropout from study. Currently, universities in the UK lack financial resources and the on-campus mental health services traditionally offered to students are increasingly economically unsustainable. Compounded by the perceived stigma of using such services, mental health providers have been driven to address the escalating needs of students through online services. Methods: In this paper, we review online support systems identified through a literature search and a manual search of references in the identified papers. Further systems were identified through web searches, and systems still in development were identified by consultation with researchers in the field. We accessed systems online to extract relevant information, regarding the main difficulties addressed by the systems, the psychological techniques used and any relevant research evidence to support their effectiveness. Conclusion: A large number of web-based support systems have been developed to support mental health and wellbeing, although few specifically target HE students. Further research is necessary to establish the effectiveness of such interventions in providing a cost-effective alternative to face-to-face therapy, particularly in certain settings such as HE institutions. © 2017 The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Spiritual Intelligence is adaptive use of Spiritual information (SI) to facilitate everyday problem solving and goal attainment. Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to identify, assess, and control the emotions of oneself, of others, and of groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Spiritual Intelligence and Emotional Intelligence with Happiness and Stress Tolerance. The sample consisted of 270 students that were selected through random sampling from University of Medical Sciences in Alborz Province. Participants completed the oxford happiness questionnaire, Spiritual Intelligence Scale, scaling of life events, Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. In this study Happiness and Stress Tolerance have been considered as criterion variables as well as four factors Emotional Intelligence (self-awareness, self-management, relationship management, social awareness) and spiritual Intelligence have been considered as predictor variables. Finally, we used Pearson correlation test, and Univariate and multivariate linear regression test for Analysis of data. It should be noted that the number of incomplete questionnaire were 21 from 270 that were left out and data related to the remaining 249 participants (118 girls, 131 boys) were used in the Analysis. The result showed that there were a positive meaningful relationship between Emotional Intelligence (self-awareness, self-management, relationship management, social awareness) and Spiritual Intelligence with happiness and stress tolerance. The result of regression analysis also revealed that four factor Emotional Intelligence (self-awareness, self-management, relationship management, social awareness) and spiritual Intelligence were the best predictors of Happiness and Stress Tolerance. Theoretical literature and researches studying have displayed that Spiritual Intelligence and Emotional Intelligence are relevant to many variables in mental health and psychological well-being. consistent with theories and previous findings present study showed that all dimension of the Emotional Intelligence and Spiritual Intelligence were significantly related to Happiness and Stress Tolerance among the students. © 2016, Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

The prevalence rates and associations with concurrent mental health and school functioning outcomes were explored for each of the four bullying involvement classification schemas, which were derived using a categorical analytic approach that relied on the same two self-report items—one targeting victimization and one targeting perpetration—in the HBSC self-report survey. Results indicated substantially different prevalence rates among the four schemas and that schemas which differentiated between higher frequencies of perpetration and victimization involvement were associated with greater odds of being at risk of psychological distress, psychological well-being, academic performance, and attitudes toward school. Findings also suggested that a continuous approach to deriving bullying involvement classifications may be useful, yet preliminary post hoc analyses indicated that this approach would yield redundant results given the parameters of the present study.

Method: Local and national data on school leaving age, attainment of National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) standards, and school rolls (total registered students for schools) were examined to clarify long-term trends and delineate these from any impacts of the Canterbury earthquakes. Results: Despite concerns about negative impacts, there was no evidence for increased school disengagement or poorer academic performance by students as a consequence of the earthquakes. Conclusion: Although there may have been negative effects for a minority, the possibility of post-disaster growth and resilience being the norm for the majority meant that negative effects on school leaving were not observed following the earthquakes. A range of post-disaster responses may have mitigated adverse effects on the adolescent population. Implications for Public Health: Overall long-term negative effects are unlikely for the affected adolescent population. The results also indicate that similar populations exposed to disasters in other settings are likely to do well in the presence of a comprehensive post-disaster response. © 2016 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Severe psychosocial deprivation, as experienced by children in early institutional care, constitutes an adverse experience with long-term negative consequences. The Bucharest Early Intervention Project sought to examine the effects of foster care as an alternative to institutional care for abandoned infants in Romanian institutions. Methods: At a mean age of 22 months, institutionalized children were randomized to foster care or care as usual. At age 12 years, we followed-up with 98 of these children (50 randomized to foster care), as well as assessed 49 never institutionalized comparison children. Adaptive functioning was assessed across seven domains—mental health, physical health, substance use, risk-taking behavior, family relations, peer relations, and academic performance. Children at or above the threshold for adaptive functioning in at least six of seven domains were classified as having overall adaptive functioning in early adolescence. Results: Among all children who had experienced severe early deprivation, 40% exhibited adaptive functioning. Children randomized to foster care were significantly more likely to exhibit adaptive functioning at age 12 years than children in the care as usual condition (56% vs. 23%). In support of external validity, children who met the threshold for adaptive functioning at age 12 years had higher IQs and were more physiologically responsive to stress. Among children randomized to foster care, children placed prior to age 20 months were more likely to meet the threshold for adaptive functioning than those placed after this age (79% vs. 46%). Conclusions: This study provides causal evidence that placing children into families following severe deprivation increases the likelihood of adaptive functioning in early adolescence. © 2018 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Method In this qualitative study, data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews using a self-designed guide from 16 participants in total, drawn from various years of the selected undergraduate programme. Findings Participants noted that the quality of the ‘learning environment’ was a key influence on their emotional well-being. They highlighted faculty role and teaching approaches, academic expectations and availability of learning resources as important factors that affected their emotional well-being as well as their academic performance. Institutional support was also deemed important. Factors associated with a ‘hidden curriculum’ were found to be a threat to students’ emerging sense of professionalism. Conclusion Suggestions are given as to how the learning environment in the nursing programme under study can be improved to take into account students’ emotional well-being.

Review methods Data extraction from and constant comparative analysis of ten (10) research articles. Results We found four main themes: (1) emotional intelligence buffers stress; (2) emotional intelligence reduces anxiety associated with end of life care; (3) emotional intelligence promotes effective communication; and (4) emotional intelligence improves nursing performance. Conclusions The articles we analysed adopted a variety of emotional intelligence models. Using the Ashkanasy and Daus “three-stream” taxonomy (Stream 1: ability models; 2: self-report; 3: mixed models), we found that Stream 2 self-report measures were the most popular followed by Stream 3 mixed model measures. None of the studies we surveyed used the Stream 1 approach. Findings nonetheless indicated that emotional intelligence was important in maintaining physical and psychological well-being. We concluded that developing emotional intelligence should be a useful adjunct to improve academic and clinical performance and to reduce the risk of emotional distress during clinical placement experiences.

The present study, namely the ActiveBrains project, aims to examine the effects of a physical exercise programme on brain and cognition, as well as on selected physical and mental health outcomes in overweight/obese children. A total of 100 participants aged 8 to 11 years are randomized into an exercise group (N = 50) or a control group (N = 50). The intervention lasts 20-weeks, with 3-5 sessions per week of 90 min each, and is mainly focused on high-intensity aerobic exercise yet also includes muscle-strengthening exercises. The extent to what the intervention effect remains 8-months after the exercise programme finishes is also studied in a subsample. Brain structure and function and cognitive performance are assessed using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalographic recordings. Secondary outcomes include physical health outcomes (e.g. physical fitness, body fatness, bone mass and lipid-metabolic factors) and mental health outcomes (e.g. chronic stress indicators and overall behavioural and personality measurements such as anxiety or depression). This project will substantially contribute to the existing knowledge and will have an impact on societies, since early stimulation of brain development might have long lasting consequences on cognitive performance, academic achievement and in the prevention of behavioural problems and the promotion of psychological adjustment and mental health.

The education process surveys were performed to analyse the practical design and content of the training sessions and included the qualitative and quantitative rates of the training practices; progress tests; content and performance analysis; plus analyses of physical fitness, progress rates and the individual motivations of the students (physical health improvement, shaping etc.) attending the fitness groups. The progress testing practices were designed to rate progress in the speed-strength abilities and strength endurance of the trunk and limb muscles. The fitness program assisted by the cardio-strength training simulators with application of special fitness exercises was designed to reinforce and develop every muscle group and build up the strength and speed-strength qualities and abilities, with the program benefits verified by the meaningful (p<0.05) physical progress rates in the course of the experiment. The study data obtained by means of variational cardiointervalometry (CIM) with the HR variability being rated by ECG made it possible to profile the vegetative nervous system (VNS) performance and the VNS functionality in the female students of the cardio-strength fitness groups in the study period. The adaptive capability disorders found by the experiment were interpreted as evoked by stresses of the neurohumoral regulatory mechanisms and dominated by dedaptation to physical workloads. The HR variability analyses and data interpretations made it possible to profile the students' cardiovascular system adaptive capability.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Recent Findings: Both the direct and flow-on effects of climate change place children at risk of mental health consequences including PTSD, depression, anxiety, phobias, sleep disorders, attachment disorders, and substance abuse. These in turn can lead to problems with emotion regulation, cognition, learning, behavior, language development, and academic performance. Together, these create predispositions to adverse adult mental health outcomes. Children also exhibit high levels of concern over climate change. Meaning-focused coping promotes well-being and environmental engagement. Summary: Both direct and indirect climate change impacts affect children’s psychological well-being. Children in the developing world will suffer the worst impacts. Mental health professionals have important roles in helping mitigate climate change, and researching and implementing approaches to helping children cope with its impacts. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Adolescents may thus benefit from brief techniques (15 min) that decrease pre-sleep cognitive-emotional arousal and sleep-onset latency. The present study used a 3 (intervention: mindfulness bodyscan mp3, constructive worry, control) by 3 (time: baseline, week 1, week 2) mixed-model design on a school-based sample of adolescents (N = 232; Mage = 15.9 ± 0.8 years, range = 14–18 years; 19% male), and a sub-sample of adolescents with prolonged sleep-onset latency (i.e. ≥30 min; N = 119; Mage = 16.9 ± 0.9 years; 21% male). It was expected that the 15-min pre-recorded breath-based mindfulness bodyscan, and constructive worry, would decrease sleep-onset latency and pre-sleep arousal similarly over time, relative to the control condition. A significant interaction was observed among adolescents with prolonged sleep-onset latency, who completed ≥3 days for at least 1 week (p =.001), where mindfulness decreased sleep-onset latency relative to constructive worry and the control. Neither technique changed pre-sleep worry or cognitive-emotional arousal, or associated daytime functioning (both the whole sample and sub-sample). A pre-recorded mp3 breath-based mindfulness bodyscan technique is a promising means by which adolescents with prolonged sleep-onset latency can decrease sleep-onset latency. This simple tool has potential for scalable dissemination by stakeholders (e.g. teachers), unqualified to treat adolescent sleep difficulties. Future studies are needed to determine whether benefits may extend to academic performance and mental health, if performed for a longer time period with increased compliance. © 2018 European Sleep Research Society","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

This study examined psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Higher Education Stress Inventory (K-HESI). Methods: The reliability and validity of the K-HESI were examined in a large scale multi-site survey involving 7110 medical students. The K-HESI, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and questions regarding quality of life (QOL) and self-rated physical health (SPH) were administered. Results: Exploratory factor analysis of the K-HESI identified seven factors: Low commitment; financial concerns; teacher-student relationship; worries about future profession; non-supportive climate; workload; and dissatisfaction with education. A subsequent confirmatory factor analysis supported the 7-factor model. Internal consistency of the K-HESI was satisfactory (Cronbach's α = .78). Convergent validity was demonstrated by its positive association with the BDI. Known group validity was supported by the K-HESI's ability to detect significant differences on the overall and subscale scores of K-HESI according to different levels of QOL and SPH. Conclusions: The K-HESI is a psychometrically valid tool that comprehensively assesses various relevant stressors related to medical education. Evidence-based stress management in medical education empirically guided by the regular assessment of stress using reliable and valid measure is warranted. © 2016 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: A 156-item anonymous online survey was distributed via e-mail to a sample of 9449 university students. Current use of alcohol and drugs, psychological and physical status, and academic performance were assessed, along with questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity and compulsivity. Results: A total of 3421 participants (59.7% female) were included in the analysis. 6.7% of the sample reported current/recent nonmedical use of prescription stimulants, while an additional 5.8% reported misuse in the past. Nonmedical use of prescription stimulants was associated with lower grade point averages, and with taking a broad range of other drugs (including alcohol, nicotine, illicit substances, and consumption of caffeinated soft drinks). Nonmedical use of stimulants was also significantly associated with impulsivity (Barratt scale), prior treatment for substance use problems, and elevated occurrence of disordered gambling, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety; but not depression symptoms or binge-eating disorder (though it was associated with using drugs to lose weight). The relationship with probable attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on screening was not significant but was numerically elevated. Finally, those using nonmedical prescribed stimulants were significantly more sexually active (including at a younger age), and were less likely to use barrier contraception. Conclusions: Nonmedical use of prescription stimulants is common in young adults and has profound public health associations including with a profundity of other drug use (licit and illicit), certain mental health diagnoses (especially gambling, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder), worse scholastic performance, and riskier sexual practices. The majority of people with nonmedical use of prescription stimulants do not have ADHD, and its link with current ADHD symptoms was less marked than for certain other disorders. Clinicians should screen for the misuse of prescription stimulants as they may be associated with a range of problematic behaviors. Risk of diversion (which may be higher for those living in shared accommodation and those with substance use disorder history) merits careful assessment before prescribing stimulant medication.

This study characterized sleep patterns in Chinese adolescents preparing for the College Entrance Exam (CEE) and evaluated the association between sleep patterns, self-rated academic performance, and the CEE scores. METHODS: A sample of 481 Chinese adolescents in 12th grade (ages 16-19 years) completed questionnaires about sleep patterns, academic performance, academic stress, and sociodemographic factors 4-6 weeks before the CEE in June 2013. The CEE scores for each student also were obtained. RESULTS: A total of 21% of the students had bedtimes after 12:00 am, 78.3% had sleep latency longer than 30 minutes, 14.6% had wake time earlier than 6:00 am, and the vast majority (94.4%) had sleep duration less than 8 hours. After adjusting for selected confounders such as academic stress, prolonged sleep latency was associated with poorer self-reported academic performance, and late bedtime was associated with higher CEE score.

Results: 43 participants (24 female) were included in the study. The number of somatization symptoms generally decreased (p ≤ 0.004) after the exam. Those who failed the admission reported higher scores on somatization (p ≤ 0.001), more depressive symptoms (p ≤ 0.039), and lower quality of life (p ≤ 0.007) at all three points of time.

However, less is known about the association between cumulative CA and PD, and the role of childhood psychopathology and school performance. The current study examined the relationship between a range of CAs and a diagnosis of PD in young adulthood, and the roles of childhood psychopathology and school performance in this relationship. All individuals born in Stockholm County 1987–1991 (n = 107,287) constituted our cohort. Seven CAs were measured between birth and age 14: familial death, parental criminality, parental substance abuse and psychiatric morbidity, parental separation and/or single-parent household, household public assistance and residential instability. Individuals were followed from their 18th birthday until they were diagnosed with PD or until end of follow-up (December 31st 2011). Adjusted estimates of risk of PD were calculated as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Associations were observed between cumulative CA and PD. During the follow-up 770 individuals (0.7%) were diagnosed with PD. Individuals exposed to 3+ CAs had the highest risks of being diagnosed with PD (HR 3.0, 95% CI 2.4–3.7). Childhood psychopathology and low school grades further increased the risk of PD among individuals exposed to CA. Cumulative CA is strongly associated with a diagnosis of PD in young adulthood. Our findings indicate that special attention should be given in schools and health services to children exposed to adversities to prevent decline in school performance, and to detect vulnerable individuals that may be on negative life-course trajectories. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Workplace interventions, clinical therapies, and popular self-help programs aimed at enhancing mindfulness abound, and research has demonstrated the efficacy of such mindfulness interventions in enhancing mindful states. It is of importance to note that research also suggests the average frequency with which individuals experience states of mindfulness varies from person to person, underscoring the existence of a dispositional tendency toward mindfulness—trait mindfulness. We meta-analytically cumulate the results of 270 independent studies (N = 58,592 adults from nonclinical samples) of trait mindfulness in order to explore its personal and professional correlates. Results suggest the benefits of trait mindfulness extend to both personal and professional domains. With regards to personal benefits, trait mindfulness was found to be positively correlated with confidence (ρ =.39), mental health (ρ =.38), emotional regulation (ρ =.40), and life satisfaction (ρ =.36), and negatively correlated with perceived life stress (ρ = –.43), negative emotions (ρ = –.40), anxiety (ρ = –.34), and depression (ρ = –.38). Professionally, results suggest trait mindfulness may benefit job satisfaction (ρ =.29), performance (ρ =.34), and interpersonal relations (ρ =.31), while also reducing burnout (ρ = –.48) and work withdrawal (ρ = –.17).

A total of 10 schools were selected for the purpose of the study. 1403 Adolescents were selected for data analysis. Socio-Demographic Performa and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ] were administered to the participants. Results The results indicated that five predictors (gender, education, family type, academic performance, socio economic status in the family) explained 9.79% of the variance (F = 5.040, P < 0.000) in total difficulty levels: (Academic performance; β = 0.08; t = 3.15; P = 0.002) and (Socio economic status; β = 0.07, t = 3.02, P = 0.003). Conclusion In the study less than one tenth of the participants have some mental health issues and this calls for concern. Schools should have standing operation procedures in place to periodically screen adolescents for mental health related issues. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Letter","Final","","Scopus"

Previous research attributes stress-reducing effects to natural environments, but has mainly focused on adults and often following leisurely relaxation in natural environments. This pilot study explores the impact of natural environments on stress response during rest and mental load and cognitive performance in 47 children aged 10–12 years in a school context. Heart rate variability measures indexing tonic, event, and phasic vagal tone and attention scores were compared across classroom and natural environments. Tonic vagal tone was higher in the natural environment than the classrooms, but no differences were found in event or phasic vagal tone or cognitive performance measures. These findings suggest a situational aspect of the conditions under which natural environments may give rise to stress-buffering influences. Further research is warranted to understand the potential benefits in a real-life context, in particular with respect to the underpinning mechanisms and effects of accumulated exposure over time in settings where children spend large proportions of time in natural environments. © 2018 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of an embedded counseling office at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry & Dental Clinics in its first three academic semesters. Data were gathered from students attending appointments, and two inventories were used to monitor students' counseling progress and gather psychological outcomes data: the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-34 (CCAPS-34) and the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS). In the three semesters, 55 students attended 251 counseling appointments, with an average of 4.5 appointments per student. Their presenting psychological concerns included academic concerns, time management, test anxiety, study skills, low self-esteem, self-care, interpersonal conflicts, anxiety, depression, stress management, sexual concerns, substance abuse, eating/body image concerns, work-life balance, and financial issues. The CCAPS-34 data showed that, at initial clinical assessment, students experienced moderate levels of depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, academic distress, and overall psychological distress; 45 (82%) showed clinically significant symptoms on at least one CCAPS-34 subscale. The ORS data further showed that the students entered counseling experiencing high levels of psychological distress. A positive relationship was found between number of counseling appointments and increased overall functioning. These results suggest that an embedded counseling office can help dental schools meet the needs of their students.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Higher levels of grit were expected to relate to greater health care management skills and HRQoL, and skills were predicted to mediate the relationship between grit and HRQoL. Methods Four hundred seventy undergraduates (Mdn age =19, interquartile range = 2) completed online questionnaires, including the short Grit Scale, Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire, and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) (HRQoL). Results Higher grit related to greater health care management skills (R 2 =0.15 p<.001), higher mental HRQoL (R 2 =0.24, p<.001), and higher physical HRQoL (R 2 =0.11, p<.001). Health care management skills mediated the relationship between grit and physical HRQoL (p<.001), but not mental HRQoL (p>.05). Conclusions This preliminary investigation illustrates the role of grit in AYA health, suggesting that it may be a target for interventions aimed at improving skills and HRQoL outcomes. © The Author 2017.

For many young adults, college and school are the best time of life. These critical years can also be undermined by depression, anxiety, and stress. Students who do not cope well with stress have a very drastic effect in their studies and behavior. Materials and Methods: A sample of 80 students were asked to answer a survey prepared in online. The results were presented graphically, inferentially, and descriptively. The objective of the current study was to assess the stress among students of various professional colleges and its association with various academic, social, and health-related factors. Result: Students studying in science stream had stress more compared to students studying in other streams. It affects them mentally, physically, and emotionally. Students face anxiety and go in to depression which later leads to decreased performance in academics. Conclusion: Stress is the body's reaction to a challenge. This research can help us in finding the reason and the causes of stress thus helping the students in finding a solution to their problems and help them enjoy their schooling stress-free and tension-free. © 2018 Drug Invention Today.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

To understand the factors related to such maladjustment, a mediational model linking youth report of parent-youth acculturation gaps to prospective changes (from spring to fall semester) in youth report of academic performance, depressive symptoms and alcohol use via youth report of parent-youth conflict and family cohesion, was studied in a sample of 248 U.S.—and foreign—born Latino youth (Mage = 15.21 years; 50% female; 67% U.S.-born). Parent-youth acculturation gaps were associated with changes in youth academic performance across two semesters via their negative impact on family functioning. For U.S.-born youth, parent–youth acculturation gaps were also linked to changes in alcohol use via parent-adolescent conflict. Results provide some support for the acculturative gap hypotheses while unique findings across nativity groups suggest that such individual-level characteristics may serve as important sources of variation for Latino youth. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Understanding the potential associations and characteristics of individuals who steal may help educational institutions, health services and young people themselves resolve difficulties before the behaviour impacts on their academic performance and health. Aims: We aim to test the hypothesis that desires to steal among students would be associated with worse academic achievements and higher rates of mood and impulse control disorders. Methods: One thousand eight hundred and five students completed the College Student Computer User Survey online and were included in this analysis at a large Midwestern United States University. Responders were grouped according to self-reported stealing urges and behaviours and were compared on measures of psychosocial function, mental health disorders and impulsivity. Results: Urges to steal were associated with worse depressive symptoms, higher levels of perceived stress and a number of psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder and multiple disorders of impulse control (kleptomania, compulsive sexual behaviour, skin picking, trichotillomania and compulsive buying). Conclusions and implications for practice and/or future research These following data indicate that stealing for many college students may be considered within a spectrum of impulsive behaviours. • Illegal behaviours among students point to mental health difficulties among them. • Our findings may provide clinicians, researchers and health professionals with a clearer picture of a range of impulsive behaviours among college students and promote treatment for this group. • Our findings could also inform preventative approaches to impulsive problems in young adults.

Being able to accurately predict groups at increased risk of      developing suicidal thoughts may aid in the development of targeted prevention programs      that mitigate increased vulnerability. Further, the predictors of suicidal thoughts      may be shared with other outcomes in adolescence. Previous research has linked many      factors to suicidality, so the objective of this study was to consider how these      factors may act together to increase risk of suicidal thoughts and other non-mental      health outcomes. Methods: Two longitudinal datasets were used in this analysis: the      National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) and the Avon Longitudinal      Survey of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). A Classification and Regression Tree model      comprised of 75 factors describing early childhood was constructed to identify subgroups      of adolescents at high risk of suicidal thoughts in the NLSCY and was validated in      ALSPAC. These subgroups were investigated to see if they also had elevated rates      of antisocial behaviour, substance misuse, poor physical health, poor mental health,      risky health behaviours, and/or poor academic performance. Results: The sensitivity      was calculated to be 22.7%, specificity was 89.2%, positive predictive value 17.8%,      and negative predictive value 91.8% and had similar accuracy in the validation dataset.      The models were better at predicting other adverse outcomes compared to suicidal      thoughts. Conclusion: There are groups of risk factors present in early life that      can predict higher risk of suicidality in adolescence. Notably, these factors were      also predictive of a range of adverse outcomes in adolescence. © 2017 Dykxhoorn et al.

It is therefore necessary to investigate how stress relates with the quality of life of students to maintain and/or improve their personal satisfaction and academic performance. A school-based longitudinal study was used to investigate the relationship between stress and quality of life of undergraduate pharmacy students. The 10-item perceived stress scale and the shorter version of the WHO quality of life scale were administered to the same participants at two time points i.e. Time 1 (4 weeks into the semester) and Time 2 (8 weeks afterwards). The correlations and differences between the study variables were tested using the Pearson's coefficient and independent sample t test. Results: The mean stress scores were higher at Time 2 compared to Time 1 for the first and second years. However, there was no significant difference in stress for different year groups - Time 1 [F (3) = 0.410; p = 0.746] and Time 2 [F(3) = 0.909; p = 0.439]. Female students had higher stress scores at Time 2 compared to male students. The main stressors identified in the study were; large volume of material to be studied (88.2%), laboratory report writing (78.2%), constant pressure to maintain good grades (66.4%) and the lack of leisure time (46.4%). Even though most students employed positive stress management strategies such as time management (68.2%), other students resorted to emotional eating (9.1%) and alcohol/substance use (1.8%). At Time 2, perceived stress scores were significantly negatively correlated with social relationship (r = -0.40, p ≤ 0.0001), environmental health (r = -0.37, p ≤ 0.0001), physical health (r = -0.49, p ≤ 0.0001) and psychological health (r = -0.51, p ≤ 0.0001). Conclusion: The study reported significant correlations between stress and various domains of quality of life of undergraduate pharmacy students. It is thus necessary to institute some personal and institutional strategies to ameliorate the effect of stress on the quality of life of pharmacy students while encouraging the use of positive stress management strategies. © 2017 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The Personal Experiences Checklist was used to measure the experience of bullying. Descriptive statistics and parametric tests were used in the analysis. Results Relational-verbal bullying was the most common form of bullying while cyber bullying was the least common type. Male adolescents experienced bullying more than females. In addition, adolescents belonging to low-income families experienced bullying more than those from moderate-income families. Finally, being bullied was negatively correlated with academic performance of students. Conclusions This study indicated that risk factors for bullying are multifaceted which necessitate the development of prevention and intervention strategies to combat bullying taking into consideration these factors.

Results indicated that although both groups were satisfied with life, the students with very high life satisfaction were at a significant advantage over those with average life satisfaction in terms of academic performance, including greater student engagement, academic self-efficacy, and approach-oriented achievement goals and lower academic stress. The most satisfied students also earned higher Grade Point Averages (GPAs) than their less satisfied peers. There were no differences in educational functioning between the average and low life satisfaction students.

To better understand overall childhood health and wellbeing, this study is investigating BOKS (Build Our Kids Success), an established ongoing before-school physical activity program, to evaluate students' physical health, mental health, cognitive capacity, and academic performance. Design and methods: The study is a non-randomized controlled trial with 26 elementary and middle schools in 3 Massachusetts communities, including first through eighth grade (aged 5-14) students, their parents, and teachers. Data collection is occurring during the 2015-2016 school year. Physical fitness is being assessed via 400 m run and anthropometrics via height and weight measures (BMI). Psychosocial outcomes are being assessed via student, parent, and teacher survey and include nutrition, daily activities, emotional and relationship scales, bullying and victimization, vitality and energy, student engagement, stress, positive affect, self-efficacy and life satisfaction. Academic performance is reported by grades. Statistical methods include a psychometric evaluation of study measures, Pearson correlations, Student's t-tests, ANOVA/ANCOVA and multivariate linear regression including multilevel modeling analyses to account for the hierarchical organization of the data. Discussion: This study is investigating a before school physical activity program on parameters of physical health, mental health, cognitive capacity, and academic performance by employing a novel triad approach, correlating the input of the child, parent, and teacher. Outcomes will evaluate the effectiveness of a before school physical activity program in elementary and middle schools and potentially provide valuable information for schools looking to institute innovative physical activity programs. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Frequently referred to as “tapping,” this technique combines the cognitive reprocessing benefits of exposure and acceptance therapy with the energetic disturbance releases associated with acupuncture and other energy therapies. More than 60 research articles in peer-reviewed journals report a staggering 98% efficacy rate with the use of this procedure from psychological distress (posttraumatic stress disorder, phobias, anxiety, depression, etc.) to physical conditions (asthma, fibromyalgia, pain, seizure disorders, etc.) to performance issues (athletic, academic). Perhaps because of this, this technique has encountered a fair degree of skepticism within the health care community. Easily taught as a self-help aid that patients can administer to themselves, EFT becomes an efficacious tool in the hands of nurses who are seeking whole person approaches for the healing of a wide variety of psychological and physical conditions. A conceptual framework, mechanisms of action, evidence of safety, literature review, and case studies are also included. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Insomnia, nightmares and impaired sleep quality lead to several mental health issues, as well as impaired academic performance. Although different sleep programmes exist, a systematic overview comparing their effectiveness is still missing. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of psychological interventions to improve sleep in college students. Seven databases were searched from November to December 2016 (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cinahl, Cochrane Library, PubMed, OpenSigle). The search string included search terms from three different topics: sleep, intervention and college students. Outcome measures included subjective as well as objective measures and focused on sleep, sleep-related and mental health variables. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. They were assigned to four intervention categories: (1) sleep hygiene, (2) cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), (3) relaxation, mindfulness and hypnotherapy and (4) other psychotherapeutic interventions. Fifteen studies were randomized controlled trials. While sleep hygiene interventions provided small to medium effects, the CBTs showed large effects. The variability of the effect sizes was especially large in the relaxation category, ranging from very small to very large effect sizes. Other psychotherapeutic interventions showed medium effects. CBT approaches provided the best effects for the improvement of different sleep variables in college students. Five studies included insomnia patients. The other three intervention categories also showed promising results with overall medium effects. In the future, CBT should be combined with relaxation techniques, mindfulness and hypnotherapy. Furthermore, the interventions should broaden their target group and include more sleep disorders. © 2017 European Sleep Research Society","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Source of data Significant bibliographical contributions produced by neuroscience, ecology, and epigenetics in the early childhood scenario. Synthesis of data Many diseases that impair the lives of adults result from severe and often uncontrollable disorders that occur in early childhood, an irreplaceable period for the safe construction of the human brain, personality, and intelligence. There is noteworthy scientific evidence that has become unquestionable, according to which abuse and neglect and other forms of violence to which children are exposed during the course of their lives, are the genesis of many physical ailments and other mental diseases, including depressive morbidity and schizophrenia. Conversely, it is also emphasized that healthy practices such as reading and listening to/playing music are able to intensively contribute to the exercise of cognitive capacity inherent to this period of life, as a prerequisite for the acquisition of learning indispensable to the high educational performance during the schooling period. Conclusion In the light of the disclosed scientific evidence, the pediatrician emerges as the most differentiated professional to provide preventive and curative care indispensable to the skilled formation of a healthy citizen. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria","Short survey","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Materials and methods: This study was undertaken in Saveetha university, Chennai among the courses-Engineering, Medicine, Dentistry, Law and MBA. A questionnaire was framed and was given to the students belonging to various departments and were asked to fill the form. 300 participants for the survey were randomly selected from various departments in the university. Background: Stress is a reaction to stimulus that disturbs our physical or mental equilibrium causing hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol to surge through the body. Stress that is left unchecked can contribute to health problems such as high BP, heart disease, obesity, mental depression and even suicidal tendency. Analysing existing literature reveals that medical students experience more stress than other professional college students. Academic factor is one of the most important stress inducing factor among professional college students. Similarly, students living in hostel are also prone to high stress levels. Result: 300 students were taken for this study. 60% were males and 40% participants were females. Students studying MBBS AND BDS suffer from high level stress. MBBS students suffer from family problems. Law students tend to have overeating habits because of stress. Academics and peer pressure is the most common factor leading to stress. Anxiety is seen in MBA students and depression is common in medical and dental students. Most of the engineering students relieve stress by spending time in Internet. MBBS and BDS students prefer sleeping to relieve stress. Conclusion: From this study, we come to a conclusion that stress is not permanent and hence a stress management protocol should to be created in order to create an emotionally balanced environment for the students which will enhance their performance and interest levels and proper counselling should be given. © 2016, Pharmainfo Publications.

Methods: From February to May 2015, three different instruments (Dental Environment Stress - DES -Psychological General Well-Being - PGWB - and SF-36 Health Survey) were applied to students from two public and two private dental schools from the State of Ceará, Brazil. Mann-Whitney test or t test for independent samples were used in order to compare the stressors between private and public dental schools students. Correlations to each DES domain were performed using Kendall’s Tau C test. Results: A total of 92 (45.32%) and 111 (56.68%) students from public and private schools, respectively, answered the questionnaire. Students from public schools demonstrated significantly higher scores in DES/academic performance and DES/personal and institutional factors (p<0.05). Significant negative correlations were detected between PGWB/anxietyand PGWB/general with all DES domains for both public and private schools (p<0.05). Additionally, DES/ academic performance was significantly correlated with several SF-36 domains, such as physical function, vitality, and social functioning, to both public and private schools (p<0.05). However, DES/academic performance and SF-36/role physical was only significantly correlated in private school students (r=-0.l71, p=0.039), while SF-36/bodily pain (r=-0.274, p<0.001), general health (r=-0.245, p=0.001), and mental health (r=-0.286, p<0.001) were significantly correlated with DES/academic performance only in public school students.

The purpose of this investigation was to identify how the frequency of physical activity and the influence of certain personality traits (perfectionism and perseverance) moderate stress. The sample was composed of 127 teenage students; tests were administered to measure perfectionism, perseverance, perceived stress, including an ad hoc sociodemographic questionnaire.

Most posters were mothers, most wrote to seek information or advice, and most received advice from other women. Parents posted on a wide range of parental concerns, most frequently the effects of children’s illness on themselves, specifically feelings of helplessness, their need for advice on their own coping, and the stress of child discipline. Parents frequently also expressed concern about child symptoms, especially poor academic performance, and had questions about efficacy, side effects of, and noncompliance with medication. Parents’ concerns did not differ by child diagnosis, gender, or age. However, parents of children with AD/HD only were significantly less likely to describe parent-child verbal or physical conflict than other forum parents.

This study aimed to evaluate the association of energy drinks with suicide, independent of possible confounders including stress, sleep, and school performance. Methods: In total, 121,106 adolescents with 13–18 years olds from the 2014 and 2015 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey were surveyed for age, sex, region of residence, economic level, paternal and maternal education level, sleep time, stress level, school performance, frequency of energy drink intake, and suicide attempts. Subjective stress levels were classified into severe, moderate, mild, a little, and no stress. Sleep time was divided into 6 groups: < 6 h; 6 h < 7; 7 h < 8; 8 h < 9; and 9 h. School performance was classified into 5 levels: A (highest), B (middle, high), C (middle), D (middle, low), and E (lowest). Frequency of energy drink consumption was divided into 3 groups: 3, 1–2, and 0 times a week. The associations of sleep time, stress level, and school performance with suicide attempts and the frequency of energy drink intake were analyzed using multiple and ordinal logistic regression analysis, respectively, with complex sampling. The relationship between frequency of energy drink intake and suicide attempts was analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis with complex sampling. Results: Higher stress levels, lack of sleep, and low school performance were significantly associated with suicide attempts (each P < 0.001). These variables of high stress level, abnormal sleep time, and low school performance were also proportionally related with higher energy drink intake (P < 0.001). Frequent energy drink intake was significantly associated with suicide attempts in multiple logistic regression analyses (AOR for frequency of energy intake 3 times a week = 3.03, 95% CI = 2.64–3.49, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Severe stress, inadequate sleep, and low school performance were related with more energy drink intake and suicide attempts in Korean adolescents. Frequent energy drink intake was positively related with suicide attempts, even after adjusting for stress, sleep time, and school performance. © 2017 Kim et al.

This study evaluated the impact of sleep-related factors on psychological wellbeing, cognitive task performance and academic standing in medical students. Methods: A total of 59 undergraduate medical students took part in this cross-sectional study over two consecutive days. Participants responded to questionnaires about their physical and psychological health, sleep, functioning and academic performance at the initial visit. Participants then wore an ambulatory bioharness overnight (to derive heart rate variability measures), before returning to complete a computerised battery of cognitive tasks. A sleep diary was completed for the next 7 days. Results: Poor sleep quality in the month preceding assessment correlated with psychological distress (p < 0.001) and reduced nocturnal heart rate variability (p = 0.007). Psychological distress also correlated with reduced nocturnal heart rate variability (p = 0.031) and less refreshing sleep during the monitoring week (p < 0.001), but not with sleep timing parameters. A greater increase in heart rate variability during the transition from awake to sleep significantly predicted better spontaneous cognitive performance (p = 0.021). Better academic standing was predicted by consistently short, less refreshing sleep (all p < 0.001), along with earlier bedtimes (p = 0.004) and greater psychological wellbeing (p = 0.009). Conclusion: Unrefreshing, short-duration sleep and psychological distress are prevalent in medical students during university training and were associated with reduced nocturnal parasympathetic autonomic activity. Achieving higher academic grades was associated with high psychological wellbeing despite consistently short, unrefreshing sleep. The long-term repercussions of such sleep behaviours on later professional functioning remain unclear, warranting further research. © 2017, © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2017.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Furthermore, several studies also suggested to university to provide a classroom with a window for viewing the landscape. The benefits gain from that has correlated with enhance positive emotions, mental health, quality of life as well as students' academic performance. Vegetation is an essential element in visual landscape assessment. Plants traits able to attract viewers attention. Better landscape scenery often composed of various plant properties with properly design based on principles guidelines. However, the study on planting composition seems neglected. Therefore, this study is to explore the significance of planting composition in visual interest within the campus context. Different context anticipated different composition depends on the location, concept or function. Crucially, students are exposure with a lot of stress and challenges. Moreover, less daily contact with nature, spend more time indoors and continuously technology connectedness has predicted to negative impact on student performance. Thus, this study is suggestive to encourage nature connectedness. Before that, the preferred planting composition must be reviewed to ensure the effectiveness in visual preferences. The review process then analyses using qualitative software Atlas.ti© Version 8.0. The precedents literature was recorded and categorised in coding. The result demonstrates that there are the factors that should be pursued to influence more visual interest, particularly on campus. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, a paucity of research has examined factors predictive of psychological distress in this population. Aims: To report the findings from a multi-centre survey of mental health among junior doctors in Ireland, and assess the extent to which moderator variables (e.g., age, academic performance, nationality, etc.) alter the levels of psychological distress caused by internship. Method: An online, anonymous, questionnaire was distributed to all interns in the Republic of Ireland in January 2012. Results: A total of 270 interns responded to the survey (45.0 % response rate), with 48.5 % of the respondents having a score indicative of psychological distress. A regression model found that nationality, academic performance, intern training network, rating of work stressors, home stressors, and work-life balance were associated with differing levels of mental health as measured by the General Health Questionnaire-12. Conclusions: There is a need to consider moderator variables when examining mental health in healthcare populations to avoid drawing overly simplistic conclusions. Interns in Ireland reported particularly high levels of psychological distress compared to other studies of mental health among healthcare populations. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The International Classification of Sleep disorders, the International Classification of Diseases and the Diagnostic and Statistical manual of Mental Disorders defines insomnia as an experience of insufficient or poor sleep quality, characterized by at least one of the following symptoms: difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, early awakenings and poor restorative sleep. In Italy, the Morfeo 1 study detects a prevalence of 20% of insomnia and a 40% of cases with day-time symptoms. The chronic sleep deprivation is responsible for cognitive disorders with effects on social life. Being common knowledge, lifestyle can also influence sleep. Some of the ""sleep hygiene rules"" involve a control on smoking, coffee consumption and diet. The Mediterranean Diet (MD), thanks to its high level of tryptophan, has a positive influence on sleep and can protect against stress and anxiety. Study design. The aim of InSOMNIA study was to determine the prevalence of sleep disorders among nursing students of the University of Perugia and, therefore, to evaluate how lifestyle, eating habits, health status and academics performance are linked to night-time and daytime symptoms of the interrupted sleep. Methods. We adopted a cross sectional survey, collecting data from ""Sleep and Daytime Habits Questionnaire"" to evaluate the sleep disorders and from PREDIMED questionnaire to assess the adherence to MD. Results. We found a statistical significant association between PREDIMED score and BMI (p-value = 0.0127), smoking habit (p-value = 0.0125), quality of life (p-value = 0.0480) and academic progress (p-value = 0.0092). Conclusions. We found a high prevalence of sleep disturbances statistically associated with diet and poor academic progress. © 2018 Societa Editrice Universo.; Introduzione. L'insonnia è definita dall'International Classification of Sleep disorders, International Classification of Diseases e dal Diagnostic and Statistical manual of Mental Disorders, come ""esperienza di sonno insufficiente o di scarsa qualità caratterizzato da almeno uno dei seguenti sintomi: difficoltà a iniziare o mantenere il sonno, risveglio precoce, sonno poco ristoratore"". In Italia, lo studio Morfeo 1 rileva una prevalenza pari al 20% con il 44% dei soggetti che presenta anche sintomi diurni. La deprivazione cronica di sonno causa disturbi cognitivi che si ripercuotono sulla vita sociale. É noto come anche gli stili di vita incidano, a loro volta, sul sonno. Alcune delle ""norme igieniche del sonno"" riguardano il fumo, il consumo di caffè e la dieta. La Dieta Mediterranea (DM), con il suo elevato contenuto di triptofano, può influenzare positivamente il sonno e proteggere da stress e ansia. Disegno dello Studio. Scopo dello studio è stato quello di determinare la prevalenza dei disturbi del sonno in studenti di Scienze Infermieristiche dell'Università di Perugia, e valutare come gli stili di vita, le abitudini alimentari, lo stato di salute ed il progresso accademico siano associati a sintomi notturni e diurni determinati da un sonno interrotto.

Thus, the purpose of the present research is to examine the influence on children's cognitive functions in multi-story residential buildings after being exposed to long periods of floor impact noise. In accordance with this purpose, the participants were chosen among fourth-sixth graders in elementary schools who have been living in multi-story residential buildings for a long time (four years or more). In present research, various recognition function domains (i.e., CAT, CCTT,K-CBCL), which are expected to be affected by long-Term floor impact noise, were tested and the two groups' performance results were compared and analyzed. In present research, results supported the hypothesis that ""children with exposure to noise transfer from other units have lower levels of attention, and academic performance, and lower scores on the assessment of verbal skills."" Specifically, the group with the most exposure to floor impact noise showed lower scores in tests for cognitive flexibility, psychomotor speed, sequential processing skills, and prolonged visual attention skills, than comparison group. The results of affect and behavioral tests showed more internalizing and externalizing problems and defiant behavior problems in the noise exposure group than in the comparison group. The high score on defiant behavior is likely related to the high score on the survey item on parents' ""constantly giving directions"" to children living in apartments exposed to noise transfer. However, the present research with its survey and neuro-psychological tests, has the limitation that causality in the relationship could not be determined, although correlations among variables could be obtained. © 2017 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

Whereas the roles of psychological coping responses, such as devaluation and disidentification, have been theorized in previous work, the present model integrates the roles of biological stress responses, such as changes in stress hormones and sleep hours and quality, to this rich literature. We situate our model of the impact of race-based stress in the broader contexts of other stressors [e.g., stressors associated with socioeconomic status (SES)], developmental histories of stress, and individual and group differences in access to resources, opportunity and employment structures. Considering both psychological and biological responses to race-based stressors, in social contexts, will yield a more comprehensive understanding of the emergence of academic disparities between Whites and racial/ethnic minorities. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Empirical research has confirmed that the University student population has a higher prevalence of mental disorder than the general population. However, no previous study has examined the mental health conditions of students in Somaliland. Methods: An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 570 undergraduate students at the University of Hargeisa in October, 2013. Study subjects were selected using a stratified random sampling. The Self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to assess mental distress. Multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify factors independently associated with mental distress. Results: The point prevalence of mental distress was found to be 19.8%. Mental distress was associated with being female (AOR = 3.52, 95% CI 1.94, 6.39), having a monthly income of 100 United States dollars (USD) or less (AOR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.12, 4.28), and not having a satisfying relationship with the family (AOR = 11.52, 95% CI 3.18, 41.72) and friends (AOR = 7.33, 95% CI 2.83, 18.93). Nearly one in five students (18.6%) has been using Khat in the previous 12 months. Khat use was also associated with greater likelihood of mental distress (AOR = 2.87, 95% CI 1.26, 6.56). In addition, financial difficulties and the poor prospect of finding a job were common sources of stress among the students. Conclusions: A significant proportion of the students at the University of Hargeisa suffer from mental distress which might have a detrimental effect on their academic performance. The mental health needs of the University students require attention with special emphasis on female students, students experiencing financial hardships, students who use Khat and those who have interpersonal problems. © 2017 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The 12-month prevalence of violence victimization requiring medical treatment was 2.4%. The results indicated that adolescents were at an increased risk for violence victimization if they were male, older, had parents of a foreign nationality, did not reside with their family, worked part time, resided in small cities or rural areas, were high or low in socioeconomic status (SES), exhibited high or low levels of academic performance, used alcohol or tobacco, and were sexually active. In addition, while violence victimization was negatively associated with perceived health and happiness, it was positively associated with perceived stress, depressed mood, and suicidality. The results indicate that a social disadvantage, involvement in risky behavior, and psychological problems are associated with violence victimization. Effective violence prevention efforts should thus target high-risk groups, and clinical attention is needed to address the psychological costs associated with violence victimization. © 2017 by the authors.

Objective To screen medical students (MS), residents and fellows for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) under the new era of work hour reform with age-matched controls from a large representative cross-sectional survey. Methods We conducted an anonymous online survey at a medical university in 2013-2014. We incorporated the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2) to screen for MDD and the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) to screen for GAD, along with additional questions on life stressors and academic performance. We compared these results to age-matched controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Results126 residents/fellows and 336 medical students participated voluntarily. 15.1% and 15.9% of postgraduates as well as 16.4% and 20.3% of MS screened positive for MDD and GAD, respectively. When compared to national estimates, the prevalence of a positive screen for MDD was over five-fold higher in medical trainees compared to age-matched controls (16% vs. 2.8%, p<0.0001). Similarly, the prevalence of a positive screen for GAD was over eightfold higher in medical trainees (19% vs. 2.3%, p<0.0001).The prevalence was consistently higher within age strata. 33.3% of postgraduates and 32% of MS believe there is a significant impact of depression or anxiety on their academic performance. For stress relief, one fifth of residents/fellows as well as MS reported alcohol use. Conclusions The stresses of medical education and practice may predispose trainees to psychopathological consequences that can affect their academic performance and patient care. The current study showed a significantly higher rate of MDD and GAD positive screens in medical trainees than the prevalence in an age-matched U.S. population, despite significant work hour reform for medical trainees. Increased awareness and support services are required at all levels of medical training. We propose that the ACGME and the Institute of Medicine may consider these findings when implementing future changes to work hour regulations. © 2016 Mousa et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Academic pressure is reported as a major trigger. Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress and is popular among students, but its effectiveness in this context needs to be ascertained. In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we hypothesise that the provision of a preventative mindfulness intervention in universities could reduce student's psychological distress during the examination period (primary outcome), improve their resilience to stress up to at least 1 year later, reduce their use of mental health support services and improve academic performance. Methods and analysis: At least 550 University of Cambridge students free from active crises or severe mental illness will be randomised to joining an 8-week mindfulness course or to mental health provision as usual (one-to-one allocation rate). Psychological distress will be measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure at baseline, postintervention, examination term and 1-year followup. Other outcomes are use of mental health services, inability to sit examinations or special circumstance requests, examination grades, well-being, altruism and coping measured with ecological momentary assessment. Outcome assessment and intention-totreat primary analysis using linear mixed models adjusted for baseline scores will be blind to intervention allocation. We will also conduct perprotocol, subgroup and secondary outcome analyses. An Independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee will be set up. We will systematically monitor for, and react to, possible adverse events. An advisory reference group will comprise student representatives, members of the University Counselling Service and other student welfare staff. Ethics and dissemination: Approval has been obtained from Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee (PRE.2015.060). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

Academic demands, self-expectations and external factors such as family pressure are kinds of stress. The stress generates physiological adaptations and affective changes that can compromise the student’s mental health. For example, there is evidence linking the relationship between academic performance and symptoms of depression and anxiety. In this context, exercise seems to be a great strategy to improve mental health and academic performance. Improvements in resilience, coping strategies, mood and affective response are positive responses to stress that are generated by molecular and structural neuronal changes. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the effects generated by academic stress on psychological variables such as affective response, mood, resilience, motivation and how exercise can contribute to a better academic life by a positive modulation of these variables. The role of exercise on the student’s life is very important for people who work in education. © 2018 Romain Meeusen, Sabine Schaefer, Phillip Tomporowski and Richard Bailey.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

The non-medical use of prescription stimulants (NMUPS) has become the subject of great interest for its diffusion among university students, who abuse these substances to cope with the increasing load of academic stress. NMUPS has been widely investigated in the U.S. due to its increasing trend; this behavior, however, has also been reported in Europe. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine stimulants misuse in a Northern Italian geographic area, identifying possible developments of the phenomenon in Italy. Methods. To evaluate academic and extra-academic NMUPS (Methylphenidate and Amphetamines), an anonymous multiple-choice questionnaire was administrated to a sample of Bachelor's and Master's degrees students attending a University North East of Italy. Data elaboration and CI 95% were performed with Excel software 2013. Fisher's exact tests were performed using Graph-Pad INSTAT software. Results. Data from 899 correctly completed questionnaires were analyzed in this study. 11.3% of students reported NMUPS, with an apparent greater use by students aged 18-22 years (73.5%) and without any statistically significant gender predominance. Fifty-seven point eight percent of students used stimulants at most five times in six months, and the most frequent academic and extra-academic reasons to use them were respectively to improve concentration while studying (51.0%) and sports performance (25.5%). NMUPS was higher among working students than non-working ones (p < 0.05), suggesting a use of stimulants to cope with stress by the first ones. Conclusions. These exploratory and preliminary data suggest that NMUPS is quite relevant in Northern Italy, suggesting a need for preventive and monitoring measures, as well as future analysis via a longitudinal multicenter study.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

We implemented the program and tested the effects in rural Chinese middle schools. The program significantly improved the tutors’ math scores and produced other benefits regarding study attitude and social behaviors. However, the program did not improve the tutees’ math scores and instead augmented their learning stress.

Due to this stress, not only the worth and value of this sacred profession is compromised but it also deteriorates the mental health and the academic performance of the students. Aim: To identify the risk factors called stressors which are causing deleterious effects on medical students and their mental health and also to quantify the magnitude of these stressors. In the long run, as a teacher, we can address that issues and if possible, can take some steps to rectify them. Material: This is cross sectional descriptive study which was conducted in obstetric/Gynae department of University College of Medicine And Dentistry (UCMD), University Of Lahore. It was a questionnaire based study in which validated Medical Student Stressor Questionnaire (MSSQ) was given to the students to identify the sources of stress in MBBS students of UCMD. Then stress level was calculated against 40 items of this questionnaire, which were divided into six domains. Six Likert scale was used for scoring system. Result: Data from 382 students were analyzed-approximately 70% were female and 30% were male. . Sample size was calculated by WHO sample size calculator where the prevalence of stress were found 46.2% among medical students with 95% of confidence interval and 5% of margin of error, the calculated sample size was (n=382) The academic related stressors and teaching & learning related stressors were found to be major stressors causing moderate to severe stress. ConclusionThe prevalence of stress is high in medical students. High stress is caused by our academic system, syllabus and curriculum as Domain 1 and Domain111 which include our teaching and learning strategies .Domain 11 also causes mild to moderate stress while IV, V and VI cause mild stress in medical students. © 2018 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

This leads to deficits in sensorimotor function and increases in workplace accidents. Using quick tablet-based tasks, we investigate whether measureable executive function differences exist following a single overnight call versus routine shift, and whether factors like stress, rest and caffeine affect these measures. Design A prospective, observational, longitudinal, comparison study was conducted. Setting An academic tertiary hospital's main operating room suite staffed by attending anesthesiologists, anesthesiology residents, anesthesiologist assistants and nurse anesthetists. Patients Subjects were 30 anesthesiology residents working daytime shifts and 30 peers working overnight call shifts from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Interventions Before and after their respective work shifts, residents completed the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and the ProPoint and AntiPoint tablet-based tasks. These latter tasks are designed to measure sensorimotor and executive functions, respectively. Measurements The SSS is a self-reported measure of sleepiness. Response times (RTs) are measured in the pointing tasks. Main results Call residents exhibited increased RTs across their shifts (post–pre) on both ProPoint (p = 0.002) and AntiPoint (p < 0.002) tasks, when compared to Routine residents. Increased stress was associated with decreases in AntiPoint RT for Routine (p = 0.007), but with greater increases in sleepiness for Call residents (p < 0.001). Further, whether or not a Call resident consumed caffeine habitually was associated with ProPoint RT changes; with Call residents who habitually drink caffeine having a greater Pre-Post difference (i.e., more slowing, p < 0.001) in ProPoint RT. Conclusions These results indicate that (1) overnight Call residents demonstrate both sensorimotor and cognitive slowing compared to routine daytime shift residents, (2) sensorimotor slowing is greater in overnight Call residents who drink caffeine habitually, and (3) increased stress during a shift reduces (improves) cognitive RTs during routine daytime but not overnight call shifts. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Purpose: The purpose was to explore academic and other sources of distress among college students with disabilities to identify possible areas where enhanced supports might benefit this population. Research Method and Design: Researchers analyzed cross-sectional data from the Center for Collegiate Mental Health to compare subsamples of students with (n = 1,774) and without disabilities (n = 1,774) on presenting concerns, and to determine significant predictors of academic distress among students with disabilities. Results: Results indicated that students with disabilities have many similar treatment concerns with their peers, but showed greater concerns in depression and self-harm; academic performance; anxiety and obsessions/compulsions; and fewer concerns in relationship problems. Significant predictors of academic distress for students with disabilities included attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression and self-harm, trauma or victimization, stress and academic performance, and social support from family and peers.

This approach is particularly fitting for students owing to a lack of mental health resources on campus and to high levels of Internet use among students. Because a history of interpersonal trauma (IPT) is associated with more distress and poorer academic performance, IPT history was assessed as a moderator of intervention efficacy. Students (N = 365) were randomly assigned to a mindfulness plus present control intervention, a mindfulness only intervention, or a stress management information condition that served as an active comparison. Prior research has supported the efficacy of the mindfulness plus present control intervention (Nguyen-Feng et al., 2015). Outcome measures were self-report measures of stress, anxiety, depression, and perceived stress completed online at preintervention, postintervention, and 2 follow-ups (2-3 weeks and 4-5 weeks postintervention). Linear mixed modeling was used to assess change over time. Participants in all 3 groups reported significant decreases on all primary outcomes. All time-by-intervention group interaction effects were nonsignificant, suggesting that the 3 conditions were equally effective. When examining IPT history as a moderator, the mindfulness plus present control and stress management conditions were both more effective for IPT survivors than the mindfulness only intervention.

Based on the research findings in cognitive neuroscience, the author explored the main factors affecting the mental health of the ATYIs through a questionnaire survey on 904 youngsters graduated in the past five years. The questionnaire evaluates the overall mental health of the respondents with four psychological test scales, namely Positive PsyCap Questionnaire (PPQ), Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Adult Dispositional Hope Scale (ADHS), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Through the analysis, it is concluded that family income, academic performance, and interpersonal relationship are the main influencing factors of the mental health among the ATYIs. The research finding provides a reference for mental health education in colleges and points the direction for the ATYIs to improve their mental health. © 2018, Anka Publishers.

One was to investigate the relationship between risk of smartphone addiction and satisfaction with life mediated by stress and academic performance. The other aim was to explore whether satisfaction with life mediated by stress and academic performance facilitates smartphone addiction. To identify test subjects, systematic random sampling was implemented. A total of 300 university students completed an online survey questionnaire that was posted to the student information system. The survey questionnaire collected demographic information and responses to scales including the Smartphone Addiction Scale - Short Version, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Data analyses included Pearson correlations between the main variables and multivariate analysis of variances. The results showed that smartphone addiction risk was positively related to perceived stress, but the latter was negatively related to satisfaction with life.

Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted with data from the 8th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web- Based Survey, using descriptive statistics, t tests, X2 test, and multilevel logistic regression analysis. Health Practice Index was calculated and a range of 0 to 2 was classified as a high-risk group. Results: The results revealed that the individual-level variables of sex, age, stress, depression, subjective health status, school performance, health education, father's level of education, and living situation were significant predictors of high-risk behaviors. The risk was greater in girls, greater with higher age and higher stress scores, greater in adolescents with depression, greater with lower paternal educational level, and greater in adolescents who did not live with both parents, as were the school-level variables of school grade and school affluence score. The possibility of being in the high-risk group in health behavior was greater if a student attended a school where the Family Affluence Score (FAS) was lower. Conclusion: School health education should be expanded to manage students' high-risk health behaviors, especially in schools that have many students from families with a low affluence status. © 2018 Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Despite this, there have been no recent, multicenter, qualitative studies assessing medical students’ perceptions of their greatest stressor(s). Objective: The goal of this study was to identify the most significant stressors noted by medical students themselves, in order to inform the development of programs and policies to reduce medical student distress. Design: Medical students from the nine schools in the state of Florida were invited to complete an anonymous online questionnaire assessing wellness and distress. Students were notified that all responses were voluntary and that individual responses would not be linked to themselves or their program. This paper focuses on students’ responses to fixed-response items regarding their experience of stress and open-ended responses to the following question: ‘What do you consider to be the greatest stressor(s) facing medical students?’ Qualitative data were analyzed using the Grounded Theory method of data analysis. Results: Results confirmed the impact of several stressors highlighted in previous studies (e.g., excessive workload, difficulties with studying and time management, conflicts in work–life balance and relationships, medical school peer relations, health concerns, and financial stressors). However, students also reported unique system-level concerns that have not consistently been highlighted in past research (e.g., medical school administrative failures, concerns about lack of assistance with career planning, and assessment-related performance pressure. Conclusions: Though individually focused interventions have demonstrated some success, medical students self-report stressors that may be better addressed through system-level changes. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

However, some ACoA are resilient to these negative outcomes. The goal of this study was to better understand the psychobiological factors that distinguish resilient and vulnerable college-aged ACoAs. To do so, scholastic performance and psychological health were measured in ACoA college students not engaged in hazardous alcohol use (resilient) and those currently engaged in hazardous alcohol use (vulnerable). Neural activity (as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging) in response to performing working memory and emotion-based tasks were assessed. Furthermore, the frequency of polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with substance use, risk taking and stress reactivity were compared between the two ACoA groups. College ACoAs currently engaged in hazardous alcohol use reported more anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms, and increased risky nicotine and marijuana use as compared to ACoAs resistant to problem alcohol use. ACoA college students with current problem alcohol showed greater activity of the middle frontal gyrus and reduced activation of the posterior cingulate in response to visual working memory and emotional processing tasks, which may relate to increased anxiety and problem alcohol and drug behaviors. Furthermore, polymorphisms of cholinergic receptor and the serotonin transporter genes also appear to contribute a role in problem alcohol use in ACoAs. Overall, findings point to several important psychobiological variables that distinguish ACoAs based on their current alcohol use that may be used in the future for early intervention. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

The central research question was the pervasiveness and specificity of these mechanisms in the link between low educational attainment and health outcomes during young adulthood. Study design A prospective longitudinal study was conducted with 808 men and women followed to age 33 years in the USA. Methods Health outcomes included major depressive disorder, obesity, chronic health conditions, and self-rated health. The focal predictor was educational attainment at age 21. The roles of the health behaviour mechanism (heavy episodic drinking, cigarette smoking, and meeting physical activity guidelines), the psychosocial stressor mechanism (stressful life events, perceived financial stress, and lack of control at work), and having health insurance (either through their employer or union or via family members) in the link between education and varying health outcomes were assessed using path analyses. Results Lack of health insurance emerged as a statistically significant explanatory factor underlying the association of education with depression and self-rated health. Health behaviours, specifically smoking and physical activity, were statistically significant intervening factors for obesity and self-rated health. Conclusions The processes linking educational attainment to health inequalities begin unfolding during young adulthood. The salience of different mechanisms is specific to a health outcome rather than pervasive across multiple health outcomes. Public health policies with a broad spectrum of components, particularly focussing on smoking, physical activity, and lack of health insurance, are recommended to promote educational equalities in multiple health outcomes among young adults. © 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health in Europe Project. Parent- and teacherreported child mental health status was based on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Sociodemographic characteristics of parents and children, as well as academic performance and use of mental health services in the previous 12 months, were collected. Countries were categorized as having high versus low mental health resources. The sample comprised 4,894 schoolchildren in seven countries. Results: Across Europe, only 25.6% of children with a mental disorder had received mental health services in the previous 12 months, including 31.5% in high-resources countries and 18.9% in low-resources countries (p=.001) (N=4,867). The presence of any mental disorder, maternal psychological distress, gender, living in a single-parent home, and low academic performance were determinants of service use. The effect of resources group on the likelihood of receiving services remained significant when the analyses controlled for all predictors (odds ratio=1.41, p<01). Determinants differed between groups-maternal psychological distress was associated with service use in high-resources countries, and gender was associated with service use in lowresources countries. Conclusions: The findings point to a substantial portion of unmet need across Europe and to major differences in access to care in low- versus high-resources countries. Efforts are needed to address unmet need among children with mental disorders, especially in low-resources countries.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

However, less is known about the prospective course of ADHD into adulthood, the risk factors for its persistence, and the possibility of its emergence in young adulthood in nonclinical populations. OBJECTIVE: To investigate childhood risk factors and young adult functioning of individuals with persistent, remitted, and late-onset young adult ADHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study sample was the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of 2232 twins born in England and Wales from January 1, 1994, to December 4, 1995. Evaluation of childhood ADHD (ages 5, 7, 10, and 12 years) included prenatal and perinatal factors, clinical characteristics, and aspects of the family environment. Among participants aged 18 years, ADHD symptoms and associated impairment, overall functioning, and other mental health disorders were examined. Data analysis was conducted from February 19to September 10, 2015. MAINOUTCOMESANDMEASURES: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria in childhood and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria in young adulthood. RESULTS: Of 2232 participants in the E-Risk Study, 2040 were included in the present analysis. In total, 247 individuals met diagnostic criteria for childhood ADHD; of these, 54 (21.9%) also met diagnostic criteria for the disorder at age 18 years. Persistence was associated with more symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 1.11 [95% CI, 1.04-1.19]) and lower IQ (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]). At age 18 years, individuals with persistent ADHD had more functional impairment (school/work: OR, 3.30 [95% CI, 2.18-5.00], home/with friends: OR, 6.26 [95% CI, 3.07-12.76]), generalized anxiety disorder (OR, 5.19 [95% CI, 2.01-13.38]), conduct disorder (OR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.03-3.99]), and marijuana dependence (OR, 2.88 [95% CI, 1.07-7.71]) compared with those whose ADHD remitted. Among 166 individuals with adult ADHD, 112 (67.5%) did not meet criteria for ADHD at any assessment in childhood. Results from logistic regressions indicated that individuals with late-onset ADHD showed fewer externalizing problems (OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.96]) and higher IQ (OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02-1.07]) in childhood compared with the persistent group. However, at age 18 years, those with late-onset ADHD demonstrated comparable ADHD symptoms and impairment as well as similarly elevated rates of mental health disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identified heterogeneity in the DSM-5 young adult ADHD population such that this group consisted of a large, late-onset ADHD group with no childhood diagnosis, and a smaller group with persistent ADHD. The extent to which childhood-onset and late-onset adult ADHD may reflect different causes has implications for genetic studies and treatment of ADHD. Copyright 2016 American Medical Association.

It is questionable if learning which is potentially troublesome should act as a form of academic assessment which is exposed to the external judgement of another and awarded a credit-bearing grade. Abstract: Introduction Despite a positive and established perception of people with lived experience of mental distress contributing to the assessment of healthcare professionals, the consequence and implications for learning are predominantly unexplored. Aim To gain a greater understanding of the influence of feedback given by people with lived experience, in the role of formative assessor, on student learning. Method Qualitative analysis, underpinned by the theory threshold concepts, was conducted on the written reflective assessments, submitted by students, following engaging in an assessment with a lived experience assessor. Results Student learning was influenced positively by the involvement of lived experience assessors in relation to person-centred care. However, students reported the experience to be anxiety provoking due to the desire to seek external approval and conceal personal challenges. Discussion The results indicate that the feedback from those with lived experience promotes greater self-awareness and empathy amongst students. The perceived expectation to present a competent and professional performance acts as a barrier to authentic person-centred practice. Implications for practice It is questionable if learning which is potentially troublesome should act as a form of academic assessment, which is exposed to the external judgement of another and awarded a credit-bearing grade. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The study examined, with two waves of longitudinal data at age 13 and age 16, how changes in perceived academic demands relate to changes in perceived stress, taking into account gender and cognitive ability, and to investigate how these factors affect the level of psychosomatic and depressive symptoms at the age of 16. A nationally representative sample including about 9000 individuals from the Swedish longitudinal Evaluation Through Follow up database born in 1998 was included. A growth modelling approach was applied to examine relations over time. The results show girls to have a considerably higher self-reported level of mental health problems at the end of compulsory school than boys. This gender difference is entirely accounted for by perceived school demands and stress in grades 6 and 9. Students who were stronger in inductive than vocabulary ability reported lower levels of perceived academic demands and less stress in grade 6. There is a need to develop interventions for minimizing the consequences of stress among adolescents and modify those particular aspects of academic demands which cause stress and poor mental health, especially among girls.

The purpose of this descriptive and exploratory study was to explore how counseling center clinicians categorize client presenting concerns, and how these concerns vary according to client demographics. Given the importance of client suicide within the field of college counseling, the frequency of suicidality as an identified presenting concern was also explored. A sample of 1,308 clinicians from 84 counseling centers rated the presenting concerns of 53,194 clients using the Clinician Index of Client Concerns (CLICC) after an initial consultation. Results of descriptive and nonparametric analyses indicated that the most prevalent concerns were anxiety, depression, stress, family, and academic performance, and that clients who belong to different demographic groups frequently present to counseling with broadly similar types of concerns. Furthermore, suicidality represented an area of concern for 8.4% of all clients, and it ranked 20 of 44 as a clinician-rated concern. Comparable rates emerged across the range of client demographic groups examined, although rates were notably higher for a handful of groups. The findings offer one of the largest and most generalizable descriptions of why college students seek counseling services, as determined by clinicians' evaluations of presenting concerns.

Academic stress leads to psychological distress and has detrimental effects on well-being. The ability to overcome such adversity and learn to be stronger from the experience is regarded as resilience. Resilience is found to have an impact on learning experience, academic performance, course completion and, in the longer term, professional practice. Resilience and positive coping strategies can resist stress and improve personal well-being. However, the relationship between resilience and well-being remains unexplored in nursing students, which are significant attributes to their academic success and future career persistence. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional descriptive correlational design. Inclusion criteria for recruitment was students studying pre-registration nursing programmes at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10) and World Health Organisation-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5) were used to measure resilience and psychological well-being respectively. Results: A convenience sample of 678 university nursing students was recruited from a university. The mean score of CD-RISC-10 was 24.0. When comparing the resilience levels of undergraduate and postgraduate students, the total scores were found to be 23.8 and 24.9 respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (p =.020). With regard to perceived well-being, the mean score of WHO-5 was 15.5. There was no significant difference between undergraduates and postgraduates (p =.131). Bivariate analysis showed that self-reported resilience had a medium, positive correlation with perceived well-being (r =.378, p =.000), and senior students had significantly higher level of perceived well-being than junior students (16.0 vs 15.1, p =.003). Multivariable regression analysis on perceived well-being indicated that self-reported resilience emerged as a significant predictor of perceived well-being (regression coefficient B = 0.259; p <.001). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that nursing students with a high level of resilience have better perceived well-being, and the level of resilience of postgraduates was significantly higher than that of undergraduates. Therefore, educational strategies should be developed in the nursing curriculum and a supportive learning environment should be created to foster resilience in the students. © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

In this respect, as an epidemiological factor, stress is considered a serious element, since it is an important generator of various pathologies. Objective: To identify the stress-producing factors and somatic symptoms of the musculoskeletal system in basic students belonging to various programs of a health school at a university in the city of Palmira. Methods: We analyzed data from three sources: a questionnaire to identify sociodemographic and academic characteristics, the Somatic Symptoms Scale (musculoskeletal symptoms) and the Academic Stress Scale. These were applied to a sample consisting of 185 participants, performing descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. Results: The faculty methodological deficiencies, together with public intervention and the exams were the stressors frequently perceived by the students, while back pain, cervical area and head with feeling of tightness were the most frequent somatic musculoskeletal symptoms. These results suggest a relationship between stressors and the presence of somatization as a response of the body to situations considered stressful in the academic field. Conclusions: Regarding somatic and musculoskeletal symptoms, there is a variability in the incidence in the study population, the most recurrent being headaches with tightness or tension, back pain and pain in the cervical area. However, the stressors that generate more perception of distress to students are the methodological deficiencies of the faculty, public intervention and exams. However, there are other factors with a medium perception of distress such as overload in the student and lack of performance control. © 2018, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

This paper reports a mixed method investigation of student self-reported psychological distress and help-seeking behaviour. The sample comprised all students (n = 1557) registered on undergraduate nursing/midwifery and teacher education programmes at an Irish university. Participants (n = 1112) completed the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) to determine their self-reported psychological distress and the Lifestyle Behaviour Questionnaire to examine sources of distress, lifestyle and demographic variables. Individual interviews (n = 59) explored student experiences of psychological distress and their help-seeking behaviours. Forty two percent of respondents exceeded the GHQ threshold ≥5, which signifies risk of mental or physical health problems. Sources of distress included academic, financial and psychosocial stressors. Regression analysis identified that demographic, programmatic and lifestyle variables predicted GHQ scores. Despite the distress experienced, students were reluctant users of support services. Many actively avoided seeking help. These findings raise serious concerns about the extent of psychological distress among this population. They also alert education providers to be vigilant for student psychological distress and to provide effective interventions, cognisant of the impact of stigma on help seeking. © 2016 Educational Studies Association of Ireland.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Although mood states have been previously studied, little is known about adaptations in other psychological responses, specifically cognition. The purpose of this study was to characterize cognitive function, mood, sleep, and stress responses at select time points of a season in collegiate rowers. It was hypothesized that during baseline, typical training, and recovery, athletes would show positive mental health profiles, in contrast to decreases in cognition with increases in negative mood and measurements of stress during peak training. Methods Male and female Division I rowers (N = 43) and healthy controls (N = 23) were enrolled and assessed at baseline, typical training, peak training, and recovery. At each time point, measures of cognitive performance (Stroop color-naming task), academic and exercise load, perceived cognitive deficits, mood states, sleep, and stress (via self-report and salivary cortisol) were recorded. Results Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant group-time interactions for perceived exercise load, cognitive deficits, mood states, and perceived stress (P < 0.05). For athletes during peak training, the perception of cognitive deficits was positively correlated with mood disturbance (r = 0.54, P < 0.05) and perceived stress (r = 0.55, P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with response accuracy during incongruent Stroop trials (r = -0.38, P < 0.05). Cognitive performance did not change over the course of the season for either group. Cortisol and sleepiness changed over the course of the season but no significant interactions were observed. Conclusion These results demonstrate that various psychological responses change over the course of a season, but they also highlight adaptation indicative of cognitive resilience among student-athletes. © 2017 by the American College of Sports Medicine.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Four hundred fifty-eight dental students (females=153; males=305) were included in the study. The age range varied from 17-to-38 years. Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Version (MBI-SV) and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) were used to gather data. Descriptive analyses, t-test, and Kruskall-Wallis test for independent groups were used for data analyses. The results indicated that 26% of all the students have burnout in terms of emotional exhaustion (25%), cynicism (18%), and academic efficacy (14%). The results showed that burnout is statistically significant in relation to demographics (p<0.05). Twenty-four percent of the students showed considerably decreased occupational performance and satisfaction scores, which suggested occupational participation limitations. Occupational performance and satisfaction scores were inversely correlated with emotional exhaustion and cynicism, while directly correlated with reduced academic efficacy (p<0.05). The results of the present study indicates that burnout and occupational participation limitation can be seen among dental students. Students with burnout may also have occupational participation limitation. Enriching dental education programs with different psychological strategies may be useful for education of healthy dentists and improve the quality of oral and dental health services. © 2017, SEAMEO TROPMED Network.

Methods Observational study of stress in a MCI. For this work, two MCI drills comprised of 40 victims each were conducted. Two randomized groups of 36 students each were created: Master's Students Group (MSG) and Undergraduate Student Group (USG). The role performed by each student (triage or sectorization) was assessed. The stress level was determined by prior and subsequent measurements of alpha-amylase (αA), HR, SBP and DBP. Results The percentage of victims that were correctly triaged was 88.6%, 91.84% for MSG and 83.76% for the USG (p = 0.004). The basal αA was 97,107.50 ± 72,182.67 IU/L and the subsequent αA was 136,195.55 ± 90,176.46 ± IU/L (p < 0.001). The baseline HR was 78.74 ± 14.92 beats/min and the subsequent HR was 95.65 ± 23.59 beats/min (p = 0.000). We found significant differences in the αA between students who performed the triage and those who performed sectorization but there were no differences between undergraduate and Masters’ students. Conclusion Conducting a simulated exercise caused stress in personnel involved in the MCI, with a greater impact on participants who performed triage, although it was not influenced by their prior academic level.

High stress has been associated with poor academic performance, negative impact on physical and mental health. This study aims to determine the prevalence of stress among undergraduate clinical students of Bayero University Kano Medical School. Materials and Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted among 224 clinical medical students from levels 400-600. The Cohen's Perceived stress scale (PSS-10) was used to assess the severity of among the students. The Chi-square test was used to determine associations and a significant association was considered at P < 0.05. Results: A prevalence of high stress of 59.8% was observed with a mean PSS score of 20.76 ± 5.58. The highest mean score of 22.29 ± 5.58 was observed among 400 level clinical students. There was no significant difference between both genders. A significantly higher proportion of students undergoing medicine, pathology, paediatrics and surgery postings were observed to be experiencing a higher level of perceived stress compared to those in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, (χ 2 = 1617, df = 4, P < 0.05). Similarly, a higher proportion of students whose fathers are educated had a significantly higher stress compared to their counterparts from uneducated backgrounds, (χ 2 = 5.54, df = 1, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Further studies to determine the causes of stress need to be carried out. This will assist the students and teachers to appropriately manage stress.  © 2016 Nigerian Journal of Basic and Clinical Sciences.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

As stress can affect psychological well-being and interfere with learning and clinical performance, there is a clear argument for universities to include health professional student well-being as an outcome in core curriculum. Mindfulness training is a potential construct to manage stress and enhance academic success. Objectives The aims of this systematic review were to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness training in medical and other health professional student population groups and to compare the effectiveness of the different mindfulness-based programs. Data Sources A literature search was completed using The Cochrane library, Medline, Cinahl, Embase, Psychinfo, and ERIC (proquest) electronic databases from inception to June 2016. Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were included. Of the potential 5355 articles, 19 met the inclusion criteria. Study Selection Participants and Interventions Studies focused on medical (n = 10), nursing (n = 4), social work (n = 1), psychology (n = 1), and medical plus other health (n = 3) students. Interventions were based on mindfulness. Data Extraction The 19 studies included 1815 participants. Meta-analysis was performed evaluating the effect of mindfulness training on mindfulness, anxiety, depression, stress, mood, self-efficacy, and empathy. The effect of mindfulness on academic performance was discussed. Data Synthesis and Conclusions Mindfulness-based interventions decrease stress, anxiety, and depression and improve mindfulness, mood, self-efficacy, and empathy in health profession students. Due to the range of presentation options, mindfulness training can be relatively easily adapted and integrated into health professional training programs. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted at Aga Khan University recruiting students from Medical School, School of Nursing & Midwifery, and Dental Hygiene program who had attended at least six months on campus from October 2016 until August 2017. The “Aga Khan University Anxiety and Depression Scale” and “Student-Life Stress Inventory” scales were used to assess depression and anxiety, and stressors. Results: A total of 283 students participated in this study and all of them scored higher than the cutoff on both scales labeling them as highly stressed. Students from dental hygiene program reported more stressors as compared to MBBS (p<0.001) and SONAM (p=0.002). Factors identified as stressors included pressure to pass exam, meeting family’s expectations of good academic performance, and missing home. Conclusion: Stress, anxiety and depression are found to be highly prevalent among undergraduate students in medical setting in Karachi. Awareness, recognition, and timely management may reduce stress among the students and improve their performance and quality of life. © 2018, Professional Medical Publications.

This study reports on the relationship between the IBS and academic stress and compares results of men and women. Methods: A random survey was made of 561 medicine students at a public university in Mexico. The ROMA III criteria were used for the IBS and the Academic Stress Inventory for academic stress. A multiple regression analysis was made. Results: The results showed that students with academic overload and lack of time are at risk for developing the IBS. Conclusions: Therefore, the recommendation is to implement educational programs aiming at self-care as well as gaining knowledge about academic stress-related factors and the physical responses that may result in repercussions with serious consequences for student life such as pain, disease and dropping out of school. © 2018 The Author(s).

Research on mental health promoting and mental ill health preventing interventions has shown promising short-term effects, though the sustainability of intervention benefits deserve closer attention. We aimed to identify, appraise and summarize existing data from randomized control trials (RCTs) reporting on whether the effects of mental health promoting and mental ill health preventing interventions were sustained at least three months post-intervention, and to analyze how the effects vary for different outcomes in relation to follow-up length. Further, we aimed to assess whether the effect sustainability varied by intervention type, study-level determinants and of participant characteristics. Material and Methods: A systematic search in MEDLINE, PsycInfo, ERIC, and Scopus was performed for RCTs published in 1995-2015 reporting an assessment of mental ill health and positive mental health outcomes for, at least, three months of post-intervention follow-up. Random-effect modeling was utilized for quantitative synthesis of the existing evidence with standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) used to estimate an aggregated effect size. Sustainability of the effects of interventions was analyzed separately for 3-6 months, 7-12 months, and 13-18 months of post-intervention follow-up. Results: About 26 studies were eligible after reviewing 6,571 citations. The pooled effects were mainly small, but significant for several categories of outcomes. Thus, for the combined mental ill health outcomes, symptom-reduction sustained up to 7-12 months post-intervention (standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) effect size (ES) = -0.28 (95% CI [-0.49, -0.08])). Further, sustainability of symptom-reductions were evident for depression with intervention effect lasting up to 13-18 months (ES = -0.30 (95% CI [-0.51, -0.08])), for anxiety up to 7-12 months (ES = -0.27 (95% CI [-0.54, -0.01])), and for stress up to 3-6 months (ES = -0.30 (95% CI [-0.58, -0.03])). The effects of interventions to enhance positive mental health were sustained up to 3-6 months for the combined positive mental health outcomes (ES = 0.32 (95% CI [0.05, 0.59])). For enhanced active coping, sustainability up to 3-6 months was observed with a medium and significant effect (ES = 0.75 (95% CI [0.19, 1.30])). Discussion: The evidence suggests long-term effect sustainability for mental ill health preventive interventions, especially for interventions to reduce the symptoms of depression and symptoms of anxiety. Interventions to promote positive mental health offer promising, but shorter-lasting effects. Future research should focus on mental health organizational interventions to examine their potential for students in tertiary education. © 2018 Winzer et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Due to restricted family support, they are at a greater risk of developing depressive symptoms than non-left-behind children (NLBC). The objective of this study is to explore how depressive symptoms and stress induced by negative life events such as interpersonal conflicts, punishment and loss, as well as their relationships vary for LBC with different left-behind-related characteristics. Methods: Using data from a large school-based survey conducted in Chongqing between December 2012 and June 2013, we first identified the differences in depressive symptoms and negative-event-induced stress between LBC and NLBC, and then analyzed the variances among LBC with different left-behind-related characteristics. The data was analyzed with Chi-square test, MANCOVA, ANCOVA, ANOVA, T-test and hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Results: We found that LBC were more stressed when experiencing negative events and had more depressive symptoms than NLBC. Children left behind by both parents were most depressed. Negative-event-induced stress and communication on life difficulties with migrant parents were risk factors for depressive symptoms, whereas adequate communication on academic performance or children's feelings was a protective factor against depressive symptoms. Communication duration and frequency, communication by visiting, communication on academic performance, life difficulties and children's feelings moderated the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms, respectively. Duration of separation, communication duration and frequency, communication on academic performance, learning difficulties and children's feelings moderated the relation between the type of parental migration and depressive symptoms, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that children left behind by both parents should be the focus of public attention for their higher susceptibility to stress-related depression. To help LBC stay mentally healthy, governments need to formulate regulations contributing to LBC's family reunion, communities need to involve more residents to attend LBC as ""surrogate parents"" and teach migrant parents to communicate with LBC properly, and schools need to teach LBC how to deal with stress and communicate with migrant parents. © 2017 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Medical School is recognized as a stressful environment that often exerts a negative effect on the academic performance, Physical health and psychological wellbeing of the students. Growing competitiveness makes the medical students more vulnerable for developing mental stress. Aim: In this background one cross sectional study was undertaken with the objective to find out behavioural aberration among undergraduate medical students. Materials and Methods: An observational cross sectional study was carried out among 100 undergraduate Medical students of age group of 18-23 years. Results were analyzed by chi-square test and percentages. Results: This survey shows that those students who were residing away from home for longer period or getting more pocket money were more alcoholic & they need more money. Association between duration of stay away from home and alcoloholism was also found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). Depression was more observed among hostelites because strict college policies, poor academic performance, education burden and financial crisis. Conclusion: Psychological well being of the medical students can be identified at an early stage and preventive measure should be undertaken.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Tobacco use is a major preventable reason for mortality worldwide. We reviewed articles from PsycInfo and PubMed with key words, resulting in 245 articles. After the examining of these articles, 76 articles were used in the final review. The commonly reported results for risk factors in the articles reported for adolescent smoking including parental/family/peer influences, depression symptoms, other substance use, stress/negative life events, and low academic performance. In prevention of smoking, the result of the current literature highlighted school-based prevention, tobacco control policy, preventive/protective factors, health-care provider influences, and peer and parental influences as possible streams to target prevention. Significant progress and research has been made over the past year, and future research is needed to continue the understanding of the risk factors of smoking for each generation. If we can understand the reasons on why adolescents smoke, we can prevent them from smoking, which will lead to a decrease in morbidity and mortality from smoking worldwide. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Aims: To assess the associations between the cognitive and emotional dimensions of exam stress and pH levels, and the predictability of salivary pH in relation to test performance. Methods: A prospective study. Eighty-three nursing students answered a questionnaire on stress appraisals, experienced stress, test anxiety (including worry and emotionality subscales) and health behaviors, and gave a saliva sample for measuring pH on the morning of their first term exam and three months later. Their performance on the test (grades) was also recorded. Results: Levels of pH in saliva were higher (levels of acidity were lower) in the post exam compared to the exam period, in parallel to lower threat appraisal, experienced stress, and test anxiety levels post exam. Controlling for smoking, physical activity and working hours per week, pH levels at both time points were predicted by appraised threat regarding the exam situation, experienced stress, and the emotionality dimension of test anxiety. pH at Time 1 predicted performance on the exams and mediated the associations of experienced stress and emotionality subscale with test performance. Conclusions: the present study indicates that pH levels may serve as a reliable, accessible and inexpensive means by which to assess the degree of physiological reactions to exams and other naturalistic stressors. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Background: Stress is considered to be a major factor affecting the health, well-being and academic performance of nursing students. Resilience has been extensively researched as a process that allows individuals to successfully adapt to adversity and develop positive outcomes as a result. However, relatively little is known about the resilience of nursing students. Design: A constructivist, grounded theory qualitative design was used for this study. Method: In-depth individual interviews were conducted with 38 nursing students enrolled in a four-year, integrated baccalaureate nursing degree programme at a university in Ontario, Canada. Face-to-face interviews were conducted from January to April 2012 using a semi-structured interview guide. Findings: The basic social process of 'pushing through' emerged as nursing students' understanding and enactment of resilience. Participants employed this process to withstand challenges in their academic lives. This process was comprised of three main phases: 'stepping into', 'staying the course' and 'acknowledging'. 'Pushing through' also included a transient 'disengaging' process where students were temporarily unable to push through their adversities. The process of 'pushing through' was based on a progressive trajectory, which implied that nursing students enacted the process to make progress in their academic lives and to attain goals. Conclusion: Study findings provide important evidence for understanding the phenomenon of resilience as a dynamic, contextual process that can be learnt and developed, rather than a static trait or personality characteristic. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Nevertheless, many UK studies investigated a narrow spectrum of variables to explore their association/s with illicit drug/s use.; METHODS: We assessed the associations between a wide range of socio-demographic, health and wellbeing variables (independent variables) and having used illicit drug/s regularly, occasionally or never in life (dependent variables). Data (3706 students) were collected from seven universities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, using a self-administered questionnaire.; RESULTS: About 5% of the sample had regularly used illicit drug/s, 25% occasionally, and 70% never. Regular drug use (RDU) was significantly more likely among males aged 21-29 years, daily smokers, those with heavy episodic drinking or possible alcohol dependency (CAGE test), and those who perceived their academic performance better than their peers. RDU was less likely among students with high health awareness and those living with parents. The predictors of occasional drug use (ODU) were similar to those of RDU. However, in addition, students with higher perceived stress were less likely, and students who felt financial burden/s were more likely to report ODU, while no association with academic performance was found. Never use of illicit drug/s was inversely associated with most of the variables listed above, and was positively associated with religiosity. Illicit drug/s use goes along with other substance use (alcohol and smoking). The finding that illicit drug/s use was higher among students reporting good academic performance was surprising and raises the question of whether illicit drug/s may be used as performance enhancing drugs.; CONCLUSION: The factors identified with illicit drug/s use in this study could be utilized to develop appropriate public health policies and preventive measures for the health of students. Multilevel, value based, comprehensive, and strategic long-term intervention plans are required. This could include social interventions aimed at generating recreations alternatives and opportunities for youth, and a critical review for current authorities' interventions and services. Suggestions for coping with problems of campus illicit drug use/abuse also need to be offered.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Common stress-relieving activities among college students include the non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD). The aim of this study was to determine the associations between self-perceived academic load and stress, NMUPD (stimulants, depressants, and sleeping medication), and dietary pattern in college students in PR. Methods: A questionnaire to evaluate academic load and stress, NMUPD, and dietary pattern was used on a representative sample of 275 first- and second-year students from one campus. Results: In total, 27.6% reported NMUPD in the past 6 months, with higher use among students aged 21-30 years (93.4%) than in those aged 31-53 years (6.6%; p=0.062). Those with high levels of stress had higher NMUPD (42.1%) than did those with low (26.3%) or moderate (31.6%) stress levels, after controlling for age and sex (p=0.03). Among those who reported NMUPD over the previous 6 months, 74% reported that such use was effective as a coping strategy, and 35% reported that it helped them to improve academic performance. Although no significant association was found between NMUPD and dietary pattern, 57% of the participants reported that their appetites decreased when they engaged in NMUPD. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study that has associated selfperceived academic load and stress, NMUPD, and dietary pattern among college students in Puerto Rico. NMUPD's prevalence was 27.6%, which prevalence appeared to be higher in students aged 21-30 years than in those of any other age. High levels of stress were significantly related to high NMUPD in this sample.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study utilizes a social ecological perspective and a stress process lens to examine the relationship between multiple risk factors and relevant indicators of youth well-being, namely depressive symptoms and academic performance, as well as the mediating role of self-efficacy (N = 1,036). Three risk models were tested: an additive effects model (each risk factor uniquely influences outcomes), a full cumulative effects model (the collection of risk factors influences outcomes), a comparative model (a cumulative effects model exploring the differential effects of normative and military-related risks). This design allowed for the simultaneous examination of multiple risk factors and a comparison of alternative perspectives on measuring risk. Each model was predictive of depressive symptoms and academic performance through persistence; however, each model provides unique findings about the relationship between risk factors and youth outcomes. Discussion is provided pertinent to service providers and researchers on how risk is conceptualized and suggestions for identifying at-risk youth. © AMSUS.

Methods: The study enrolled 137 CHD patients (79 male), with age ranging from 12 to 26 years old (M = 17.60 ± 3.450 years). The patients were interviewed regarding social support, family educational style, self-image, demographic information, and physical limitations. They responded to questions in a standardised psychiatric interview (SADS-L) and completed self-reported questionnaires for the assessment of quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) and psychosocial adjustment (YSR/ASR). Results: We found a 19.7% lifetime prevalence of psychopathology in our patients (27.6% in female and 13.9% in male). Of them, 48% had retentions in school (M = 1.61 year ± 0.82). The perception of quality of life in CHD patients is better compared with the Portuguese population in the social relationships and environmental dimensions. However, it is worse in complex forms of CHD than in moderate-to-mild ones, in cyanotic versus acyanotic patients, in moderate-to-severe versus mild residual lesions, in patients submitted versus those not submitted to surgery, in patients with versus without physical limitations, and patients who have need for medication versus those who do not. Social support is very important in improving quality of life of patients in all dimensions as well as academic performance. Conclusions: Female patients and patients with poor academic performance and poor social support have worse psychosocial adjustment and perception of quality of life. © Cambridge University Press, 2014.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Although a number of factors, including biological changes in sleep associated with puberty, lifestyle choices, and academic demands, negatively affect middle and high school students' ability to obtain sufficient sleep, the evidence strongly implicates earlier school start times (ie, before 8:30 AM) as a key modifiable contributor to insufficient sleep, as well as circadian rhythm disruption, in this population. Furthermore, a substantial body of research has now demonstrated that delaying school start times is an effective countermeasure to chronic sleep loss and has a wide range of potential benefits to students with regard to physical and mental health, safety, and academic achievement. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports the efforts of school districts to optimize sleep in students and urges high schools and middle schools to aim for start times that allow students the opportunity to achieve optimal levels of sleep (8.5-9.5 hours) and to improve physical (eg, reduced obesity risk) and mental (eg, lower rates of depression) health, safety (eg, drowsy driving crashes), academic performance, and quality of life.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The continuous stress can lead to the complications such as physical, mental and emotional injuries. Strengthening the physical, mental and social resources can improve the performance and health of students against stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the stress level and identify the stressors in faculty of dentistry in medical sciences of Babol.; METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done in academic year of 2013-2014 on dentistry students who entered the Dentistry Faculty of Babol from 2008. In this research, two questionnaires were concurrently used. The first questionnaire was DASS21 and the second one was derived from the research of Mashhad Dentistry Faculty to investigate the factors that generate the stress. Questionnaires were analyzed based on the variables of gender, age and entrance year.; FINDINGS: 217 students included 96 male (44.2%) and 121 female (55.8%) completed the questionnaires. 74.2% of students who were in fourth grade had abnormal stress. In addition, there was no significant difference in the stress mean of two genders. Role of the academic stressors such as failing in final exam, embarrassing to injure the patients and to catch the infectious diseases significantly was higher than the non-academic stress factors on the stress level of students.; CONCLUSION: The results showed that the dentistry students had high levels of stress and most of them were related to academic factors. © 2014 Babol University of Medical Sciences.

Training designed to encourage interns to speak up was designed, conducted, and evaluated at University Hospital Galway, an academic teaching hospital affiliated with the National University of Ireland, Galway, in January 2012-March 2012 and November 2012-January 2013. Method: Training, which was based on the Crew Resource Management model, was constructed around filmed stories of attending physicians describing situations in which, when they were interns, their communication and assertiveness skills were challenged, and their reflections on what they could have done better. Results: A total of 110 interns attended the training. The feedback from participants was positive. There was a significant increase in knowledge as a result of the training, and some evidence to support a shift in attitudes in the desirable direction relating to the need to speak up to seniors. No effect of the training was found on behavior. Conclusions: The willingness to share examples of poor performance is an important part of building a good safety culture. Listening to the stories of attendings describing and reflecting on a situation in which they struggled is a powerful teaching method for training interns in the communication and assertiveness skills that are critical to their job. However, a sustained change in attitudes and behavior to speaking up will require a reinforcement of learning with deliberate practice to develop the skills introduced through the training program.

The aims of the present study were to assess the current prevalence of depression and its related factors among secondary school students in Pasir Gudang, South Malaysia. In this cross sectional study, 2,927 secondary school students (13-17 years old) from urban areas were screened for symptoms of mental disorder as well as demographic and risk behaviors using a validated Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) 12 questionnaire. The majority of the respondents (53.8%) were Malay, of which 53.1% were female. Symptoms of mild depression were found in 33.2% of the respondents, while the prevalence of the symptoms of moderate, severe, and extremely severe depression was 21.5%, 18.1%, and 3.0%, respectively. Logistic regression suggested that participants who were Chinese or had a lower average grade were three times more likely to have depression, while those who came from a single-parent family were twice as likely to have this condition. This study indicated that academic performance and risk behaviors along with the demographic characteristics are important contributors to adolescent depression. © 2016 SEAMEO TROPMED Network.

In the present day scenario every one of us has vulnerability to have psychiatric morbidity. Like other young adults, undergraduate dental students are similarly vulnerable to turmoil due to academic and social stresses, which often hamper the educational achievement. Early detection and treatment of psychological morbidities shorten the suffering leading to less social impairment in long term. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the psychiatric morbidity of dental students and the factors affecting their mental health. Settings and Design: This cross sectional, descriptive and correlation study was conducted in North Bengal Dental College, a rural dental college of West Bengal, India. Materials and Methods: The study sample consisted of a total of 89 dental students. The student enrollment was done by “simple random sampling method”. The semi-structured proforma and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-28 were used to collect data and to assess the psychiatric morbidity. Statistical Analysis: Pearson’s correlation followed by multivariate linear regression analysis was done to assess the effect of academic achievement, positive and negative event on the GHQ total score. Results: The overall mean GHQ total score in the study population was 5.33, with a SD of 4.85 which was above the cutoff (>4) score. Karl Pearson correlation co-efficient r-values for GHQ total score with ‘academic achievement’ and ‘negative events’ score were 0.718 and 0.628 respectively and p-values were 0.001 and 0.001. Conclusion: The poor academic performance and negative events had strong impact on psychological morbidity of dental students. The findings of our study can’t be generalized for all undergraduate dental student due to small sample size and non inclusion of many other variables. © 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

We explored the prevalence and sex differences of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in freshmen Latino college students in Puerto Rico, and identified stressful life events that could contribute to symptoms of depression. Methods: Two thousand one hundred sixty-three freshmen college students from the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) public education system were assessed for depression symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and stressful life events using open questions. Results: Nine percent of the sample reported depression symptoms at a moderate or severe level (BDI>20). Chi square analyses revealed a significantly higher prevalence for three of the stressful life events in females than males: relocation (10.2% females vs. 7.3% males; X2 (1)=4.13, p=.042), break-up of a significant relationship (25.3% females vs. 17.8% males; X2 (1)=13.76, p<.001), and illness (11.2% females vs. 7.3% males; X2 (1)=7.23, p=.007). The model that best explained the variance of BDI scores among females was the presence of suicide risk, relationship break-up, illness, and relocation for college, whereas for males a similar model without the relationship break-up variable resulted in a better fit. Conclusions: Freshmen college students present a broad range of depression symptoms and certain stressful life events are associated with an increased prevalence of depression symptoms. Early detection of depression and tailored prevention programs should be developed to improve both mental health and academic performance among the college population. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Aim of the study is assessing sleep quality and determining some factors affecting sleep quality in the students living in the residence hall of a university. METHOD: It is a cross sectional study conducted with 277 students, 180 of whom are female. Data were collected via a questionnaire including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and socio-demographic characteristics query. RESULTS: According to PSQI, 41.1% of students have bad sleep quality. Sleep quality of male students and students who are overweight/obese or living in more crowded rooms in the hall of residence is worse than other students’. Prevalence of bad sleep quality is higher in medication users, participants thinking that they have problems in sleeping or falling asleep and had stressful experience in the last month. The differences between groups were statistically significant. In logistic regression analyzes, using medication (OR=2.54), having problems in sleep (OR=12.75), having problems in falling asleep (OR=8.83) and bad experiences in the last month (OR=2.66) have effects on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions about sleep disorders are important due to their preventable characteristics. Developing healthy life habits, improving physical conditions and coping with stress will be effective on preventing and treating sleep disorders. © 2015,Gulhane Military Medical Academy.

This review aims to evaluate critically the literature that has documented the effectiveness of SIT to reduce test anxiety. Ten studies were examined by considering a series of methodological features, such as the type of participants, the sample selection criteria, the type of training, the type of control group and the presence of a follow-up. Furthermore, the effects of SIT on four discomfort variables (trait test anxiety, state test anxiety, trait anxiety and stress) and two performance variables (test results and academic results) were analysed. It was found that SIT is able to reduce brooding and physiological hyperactivation associated with test anxiety, whereas an increase in exam performance does not occur. These findings are discussed in the light of the efficacy of other treatments within behaviour therapy which aim to reduce test anxiety.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Current psychological and physical status was assessed, along with academic performance. Positive screens for SPD were determined based upon individuals meeting full proposed DSM-V criteria. Results: A total of 1916 participants (31.9%; mean age 22.7±5.1; 58.1% female) responded and were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of SPD was 4.2% (females=5.8%; males=2.0%). SPD was associated with significantly higher lifetime rates of affective, anxiety, eating, substance use and impulse control disorders. Men with SPD had significantly higher BMI ratings and perceived themselves as significantly less attractive to others while women had significantly higher depressive symptoms. Conclusion: SPD is common in both genders and is associated with significant mental and physical health detriments, including higher levels of stress, more psychiatric comorbidity and poorer perceived health. Academic institutions, clinicians and public health officials should be aware of the multimodal presentation of SPD and screen for it in primary care and dermatologic settings. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The Mental Health of students depends on the acquiring adequate knowledge on basic concepts within a time period or academic schedule. It's obviously significance to evaluate and appraise the stress stimulators as a challenge or threat. The theoretical framework for the study was designed for analyzing the stress stimulators, academic performance and EMIS accessibility. The sample examined in this study was stratified random sample from 75 students specifically all engineering college in Dindigul District of Tamilnadu. The primary factor is the academic stress stimulators that form one module of EMIS for each of the key variable such as curriculum & instruction related stressors, placement related, teamwork related and assessment related. The Mental Health related stress stimulators namely curriculum & syllabus, placement related, assessment related and team work related have a significant influence on academic performance by students in various institution. The important factor leading to the EMIS application in monitoring stress stimulators is curriculum & syllabus related and assessment related. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Earlier studies on tracking students’ happiness in academia showed that many of them struggle with mental health issues. For example, a 2015 study at the University of California Berkeley found that 47% of graduate students suffer from depression, following a 2005 study that showed 10% had considered suicide. This is the first large-scale study that uses signals from social media to evaluate students’ emotional wellbeing in academia. This work presents fine-grained emotion and opinion analysis of 79,329 tweets produced by students from 44 universities. The goal of this study is to qualitatively evaluate and compare emotions and sentiments emanating from students’ communications across different academic discourse types and across universities in the U.S. We first build novel predictive models to categorize academic discourse types generated by students into personal, social, and general categories. We then apply emotion and sentiment classification models to annotate each tweet with six Ekman’s emotions – joy, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, and surprise and three opinion types – positive, negative, and neutral. We found that emotions and opinions expressed by students vary across discourse types and universities, and correlate with survey-based data on student satisfaction, happiness and stress. Moreover, our results provide novel insights on how students use social media to share academic information, emotions, and opinions that would pertain to students academic performance and emotional well-being. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Medical school is recognized as a stressful environment that often has a negative effect on students' academic performance, physical health, and psychosocial well-being. Previous studies have not identified differences between depressed and nondepressed and anxious and nonanxious medical students' experiences of stress or their reactions to stressors. The present study aimed to identify the prevalence of depression and anxiety among a sample of 358 medical students attending a private university in Malaysia and to examine differences according to participants' gender, year of study, and stage of training (preclinical and clinical). Additionally, this study examined the extent to which stress predicts depression and anxiety, differences between depressed and nondepressed medical students' experiences of and reactions to stressors, and differences between anxious and nonanxious medical students' experiences of and reactions to stressors. Methods. The Student Life Stress Inventory was used to measure stress and reaction to stressors and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale was used to measure depression and anxiety. Results. The results showed that 44% (n=158) of the students were anxious and 34.9% (n=125) were depressed. More female students exhibited anxiety compared to male students. Stress is a predictor for depression and anxiety. A significant difference was found between depressed and nondepressed and anxious and nonanxious students' experience of stressors due to frustration, change, and their emotional reaction to stressors. Conclusion. Overall, depressed and anxious students were found to experience more stress and react differently to stressors compared to nondepressed and nonanxious students. © 2014 Coumaravelou Saravanan and Ray Wilks.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Several factors contribute to their stress and proven to have a detrimental effect on their performance. Hence, stress becomes ubiquitous in academic environment due to higher expectations in academic achievement, poor time management, and financial concerns. It has an adverse effect on the quality of their life affecting both physical and mental health. It is a guarantor for depression and suicidal risks if left unnoticed over a longer period. The traditional stress detection system is based on physiological signals and facial expression techniques. The major drawback is the uncertainty that arises due to numerous external factors like sweating, room temperature, anxiety. Some methods like hormone analysis have a drawback of invasive procedure. There is a need for a method that is non-invasive, precise, accurate and reliable. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a perfect tool as it is a non-invasive procedure. Also, it receives feedback from stress hormones; it can serve as reliable tool to measure stress. This research work aims to detect stress for students based on EEG as EEG displays a good correlation with stress. The EEG signal is pre-processed to remove artefacts and relevant time-frequency features are extracted using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). The extracted features are manipulated to detect stress levels using hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results revealed the efficiency of the system to detect stress in real time using their brain wave. © 2016, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

There is little evidence to what extent the level of school achievements shapes this relationship.; AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate determinants of subjective health complaints in schoolaged children, taking into account the interaction effects.; METHODS: Anonymous survey was conducted in Poland in 2013/2014 on the sample of 4,545 students, as a part of the HBSC (Health Behaviour in School-aged Children) study. On the basis of prevalence of eight symptoms in the past 6 months, a standardized index of health complaints (SCL - Subjective Complaints Checklist) was calculated (0-100). To predict its variability three hierarchical linear models (five blocks) were estimated, separately for three levels of school achievements. Support from family, classmates and teachers as well as family communication were considered as protective factors, which can reduce the negative impact of stress. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender and family affluence.; RESULTS: The standardized SCL index was equal to 23.2 in boys and 32.5 in girls. The high level of school stress was reported by 28.5% boys and 35.6% girls, respectively. Regarding these two measures, similar patterns of change were observed, increase with age and with deterioration of academic achievement. Final multivariate models explained 22-25% variability of SCL, slightly more among worst students. Accumulation of low family support and high level of school stress caused the highest increase in the SCL index in very good students.; CONCLUSIONS: School performance is an important determinant of subjective health complaints in adolescence, also modifying the impact of other risk and protective factors.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Following exposure to disasters, adolescents may undergo mental health challenges that threaten factors critical to school satisfaction, such as positive school climate and supportive school relationships. Objective: The current study examined the mediating role of posttraumatic stress symptoms on the relationship between exposure to a hurricane and school dissatisfaction. Method: Regression analyses were used to test relationships in a large sample of predominately White female high school students who participated in a needs assessment 6 months after Hurricane Katrina. Results: Results revealed a significant, direct association between hurricane exposure and dissatisfaction with school, as well as indirect associations via posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for research to explicate the relationship between disasters and school satisfaction. Research is also needed to determine whether school-based interventions that have shown success in reducing anxiety symptoms in youth post-disaster also work to minimize disruptions in the school environment and ultimately reduce dissatisfaction with school. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Hypotheses: Self-reported stress and quality of life among sophomore medical students having different types of preclinical curricula will vary in their relationships to USMLE Step 1 scores. Method: Voluntary surveys in 2010 and 2011 compared self-reported stress, physical and mental health, and quality of life with Step 1 scores for beginning sophomore students in the final year of a traditional, discipline-based curriculum and the 1st year of a revised, systems-based curriculum with changed grading system. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Spearman rank correlations were used to analyze data, significant at p <.05. Results: New curriculum students reported worse physical health, subjective feelings, leisure activities, social relationships and morale, and more depressive symptoms and life stress than traditional curriculum students. However, among curriculum-related stressors, few differences emerged; revised curriculum sophomores reported less stress working with real and standardized patients than traditional students. There were no class differences in respondents’ Step 1 scores. Among emotional and physical health measures, only feelings of morale correlated negatively with Step 1 performance. Revised curriculum students’ Step 1 scores correlated negatively with stress from difficulty of coursework. Conclusions: Although revised curriculum students reported worse quality of life, general stress, and health and less stress from patient interactions than traditional students, few measures were associated with performance differences on Step 1. Moreover, curriculum type did not appear to either hinder or help students’ Step 1 performance. To identify and help students at risk for academic problems, future assessments of correlates of Step 1 performance should be repeated after the new curriculum is well established, relating them also to performance on other standardized assessments of communication skills, professionalism, and later clinical evaluations in clerkships or internships. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Few studies have explored the relative size of these various stressors to identify which are most important. This study was undertaken to quantify the magnitude of various sources of stress among students of a medical college at Kolkata, West Bengal, and also to assess the reliability of Medical Students’ Stressor Questionnaire (MSSQ‑40) in this context. Methods: We evaluated the degree of stress along various dimensions using the MSSQ‑40, a scale to measure stress among medical students that has been validated in other countries. Differences in stress and its causal factors were analyzed across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the MSSQ‑40 was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha. Results: The overall prevalence of stress was 91.1% and the vast majority of students (94.9%) were stressed due to academic reasons. Academic related stress was found to be higher among students who are not conversant with the local language, experienced a change in medium of teaching from secondary school to medical school, and resided in a hostel. The MSSQ‑40 in general, and its academic‑related stress domain specifically, were found to be reliable in our setting. Discussion: Early detection and remedying stressors will help to build physical and mental health in medical students. Language training early during the medical course might reduce academic stress among our students. Further studies should relate individuals’ stress with their academic performance. © 2015, Network: Towards Unity for Health. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Patients who had undergone surgery had worse quality of life in physical terms (t=- 1.989; p=0.050), social relationships (t=-2.012; p=0.048) and general quality of life (U=563.000; p=0.037), compared to those who were not operated. Better social support was associated with better quality of life in physical terms (t=3.287; p=0.002) and social relationships (t=3.669; p=0.000). Better school performance was also associated with better overall quality of life (U=457.000; p=0.046), less withdrawn behavior (U=812.500; p=0.031), fewer feelings of anxiety and depression (U=854.000; p=0.009), fewer attention problems (U=903.500; p=0.001), and lower scores for internalization (U=817.000; p=0.029) and externalization (U=803.500; p=0.042). Physical limitations had a detrimental effect on quality of life (U=947.500; p=0.001). Discussion: Female participants were more prone to worse psychological adjustment and to psychopathology. Patients with complex forms of CHD showed worse PSA, as they need regular care, which restricts social contact with peers and family and integration in school and leisure activities. Patients who had undergone surgery showed worse quality of life as they often have long hospital stays, during which social activities are restricted, making it more difficult for them to develop a good social support network. They require close medical care, and the restrictions on their activities may be life-limiting. Their sense of survival may also be threatened. Conclusions: Patients with CHD appear to be more prone to psychopathology and female patients are more likely to show worse PSA. Social support was shown to play a crucial role in buffering stress and promoting patients' adjustment. ©2011 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

Aim: The present cross sectional survey is aimed to probe the positive networking between physical exercise and academic performances amongst future medical professionals in Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA). Review of literature: The reviews of previous researches validate that there may be some short-term improvements of stress related positive mental activity such as memory enrichment but the long-term improvement of academic achievement as a result of more vigorous physical activity is not well corroborated. The relationship between physical activity in student and academic outcomes requires further exposition. Justification: Since previous research did not clearly state the positive relationship between exercise carried out by students and academic excellence in a longer time span, therefore our research aims to find out apt exercise(s) that students prefer in improving their mental state and in turn academic enrichment among both preclinical and clinical phase MBBS students in UniSZA through survey done by questionnaires. Expected outcome: The outcome of this research will hopefully benefit not only the medical students of UniSZA but also others by encouraging a healthy lifestyle and also reduce the incidence of chronic health diseases. Methodology: The respondents are the future medical professionals (year I to V) of UniSZA residing in MAIDAM with 100 in number which includes both genders and different races. Results and Interpretation: The following yardsticks were scrutinized through the questionnaire and were tabulated as per the detail furnished. i.e. choice of exercise, period of practice, duration of exercise per session, past and current CGPA results, and their level of stress. Conclusion: From this cross sectional study among future UniSZA meducationists, it could be postulated that the choice of physical exercise may have an impact on stress-free academic performance. © RJPT All right reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The goal of this research was to examine the role of work-family conflict as a mediator of relationships between features of the work environment and worker well-being and organizational outcomes. A sample of 3,326 Australian university workers responded to an online survey. Work-family conflict added substantially to the explained variance in physical symptoms and psychological strain after taking account of job demands and control, and to a lesser extent to the variance in job performance. However, it had no extra impact on organizational commitment, which was most strongly predicted by job autonomy. Despite differing in workloads and work-family conflict, academic (""faculty"") and nonacademic staff demonstrated similar predictors of worker and organizational outcomes. Results suggest two pathways through which management policies may be effective in improving worker well-being and productivity: improving job autonomy has mainly direct effects, while reducing job demands is mediated by consequent reductions in work-family conflict. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The current study explored student Veterans’ per­ceived facilitators and barriers to achieving academic goals. Thirty-one student Veterans completed self-report measures and interviews. Results suggested that Veterans who were reporting problems or symptoms in one mental or physical health domain were likely to be reporting symptoms or prob­lems in others as well. The interview data were coded, and three overarching themes related to barriers and facilitators emerged: person features (e.g., discipline and determination, symptoms and stressors), institutional structure (i.e., what schools and the Department of Veterans Affairs do that was perceived to help or hinder student Veteran success), and pol­icy concerns (i.e., how the structure of the GI Bill affects stu­dent Veteran school experience).

Prior research has aimed to identify individuals most at risk for the development of these stress-related maladies by examining factors that may contribute to inter-individual differences in HPA responses to acute stress. The objectives of this study were to investigate, in adolescents, (1) whether differences in neurocognitive abilities influenced cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor, (2) whether internalizing psychiatric disorders influenced this relationship, and (3) whether acute cognitive stress-appraisal mechanisms mediated an association between neurocognitive function and cortisol reactivity. Subjects were 70 adolescents from a community sample who underwent standardized neurocognitive assessments of IQ, achievement, and declarative memory measures at mean age 14 and whose physiological and behavioral responses to a standardized psychosocial stress paradigm (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) were assessed at mean age 18. Results showed that, among all adolescents, lower nonverbal memory performance predicted lower cortisol reactivity. In addition, internalizing disorders interacted with verbal memory such that the association with cortisol reactivity was strongest for adolescents with internalizing disorders. Finally, lower secondary cognitive appraisal of coping in anticipation of the TSST independently predicted lower cortisol reactivity but did not mediate the neurocognitive-cortisol relationship. Findings suggest that declarative memory may contribute to inter-individual differences in acute cortisol reactivity in adolescents, internalizing disorders may influence this relationship, and cognitive stress appraisal also predicts cortisol reactivity.

Because of the variable and often prolonged period between factors in childhood and the identification of mental illness in adults, prospective studies, particularly birth cohorts, offer the best chance of demonstrating associations in individuals. A review was undertaken in 2006 of the published literature from longitudinal studies, together with some large-scale retrospective studies and relevant reviews which provided supplementary evidence. The main focus was upon potentially ameliorable characteristics, experiences or situations of childhood; however, other factors, not determinants but precursors, associated with later mental illness could not be left out. Seven major electronic data-bases of published research were interrogated with a range of key-words and the results supplemented from personal searches, enquiries and reference trails. In excess of 1,500 abstracts were read to select 250 papers for full review. The material was assessed in relation to ten factors: Psychological disturbance; Genetic Influences; Neurological Deviance; Neuroticism; Behaviour; School Performance; Adversity; Child Abuse or Neglect; Parenting and parent-child relationships; Disrupted and Disfunctional Families. In 2011 the search was repeated for the period 2006 to mid-2011, using the same search terms and supplemented in the same manner. Over 1,800 abstracts emerged and almost 200 papers selected for more detailed review. These were then integrated into the original text with modifications where necessary. The whole text was then revised and edited in January / February 2012. There is continuing evidence for the association with later mental ill-health for each of these ten factors, but with different degrees of conviction. The evidence for each is discussed in detail and weighed both separately and in relation to others. These are then summarised, and the research implications are considered. Finally, the implications for prevention are discussed together with the practical potential for preventive and health-promoting programmes. © Fryers and Brugha.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

A significant portion of this sample of college students met proposed DSM-5 criteria for chronic insomnia (9.5%). The chronic insomnia group reported significantly worse sleep, fatigue, depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life, and greater hypnotic and stimulant use for sleep problems. There were no differences between groups on excessive daytime sleepiness, academic performance, or substance use. This was a rigorous and comprehensive assessment of the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of insomnia. Insomnia is a significant problem in college students and should be regularly assessed.

This study aimed to assess the psychological well-being among medical and dental students in Saudi Arabia, identify the high-risk groups and assess the association between the psychological well-being and the academic performance. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 422 preclinical medical and dental students at Umm Al-Qura University, Saudi Arabia, were recruited to assess their depression, anxiety, stress, self-efficacy and satisfaction with life levels using 21-items Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), General Self-Efficacy (GSE) scale and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Students' academic weighted grades were obtained later. Descriptive statistics and univariate general linear model were used to analyse data. Results: High levels of depression (69.9%), anxiety (66.4%) and stress (70.9%) were indicated, whereas self-efficacy (mean = 27.22, sd = 4.85) and life satisfaction (mean = 23.60, sd = 6.37) were within the normal range. Female medical students had higher psychological distress in contrast to dental students. In general, third-year students were more depressed and stressed in comparison with second-year students, except for stress among dental students. Moreover, all females had higher self-efficacy than males. Life satisfaction was higher within the second-year and high family income students. Depression was the only psychological variable correlated with the academic performance. Conclusion: High levels of psychological distress were found. Female medical students had higher psychological distress than males, whereas male dental students had higher distress than female. Medical students at third year were more depressed and stressed. Dental students were more depressed in the third year, but more stressed in the second year. Attention should be directed towards reducing the alarming levels of depression, anxiety and stress among medical and dental students. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.

In a prospective longitudinal study we examine whether PDE moderates the link between stress reactivity and cognitive functioning in adolescence. Participants were 76 prenatally drug-exposed and 61 nonexposed (NE) community comparison African American youth (50% male, mean age 14.17 years) living in an urban setting. All participants completed neuropsychological and academic achievement tests (Children's Memory Scales, the California Verbal Learning Test - Children's version and the Wide Range Achievement Test 4) over the course of 1 day in a laboratory setting. Two mild stressors (Balloon Analog Risk Task - Youth and Behavioral Indicator of Resilience to Distress) were administered, with saliva samples (assayed for cortisol) collected pre- and poststress task. A higher percentage in the NE group, compared to the PDE group (26% vs. 12%, χ2 = 4.70, d.f. = 1, n = 137, p = 0.03), exhibited task-related increases in salivary cortisol. PDE moderated the association between stress reactivity and 11 of 15 cognitive performance scales. In each case, the NE stress reactive group had better cognitive performance than either the NE lower cortisol reactive group or the PDE group regardless of stress reactivity status. Stress-related reactivity and regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in adolescence may be disrupted by PDE, and the disruption may be linked to lower cognitive performance. © 2014 S.

Past research differentiated affective rumination from problem-solving pondering. The aim of the present study was to test a moderated mediation model for these two distinct ruminative states and to show how personality (i.e. neuroticism and conscientiousness) can alter the mediating effect. The present study is based on 119 surveys from dental students with a time lag of 6 months. Participants filled out questionnaires assessing specific study-relevant performance demands, rumination and personality and a screening measure for psychological health status. Neuroticism was found to moderate the demand-affective rumination association, but conscientiousness did not moderate the demand-problem-solving pondering association. Moderated mediation analysis revealed that affective rumination mediates the impact of demands on psychological health only for individuals low in neuroticism. Findings are discussed regarding potential interventions for dental students to prevent negative psychological health outcomes due to increased work-related demands in the long term.

A group of 79 children, ages 5 to 14 years, who had experienced MTBI, were studied from consecutive hospital admissions with semistructured psychiatric interviews soon after injury (baseline); 60 children were reassessed 12 months post-injury. Standardized instruments were used to assess injury severity; lesion characteristics; pre-injury variables, including psychiatric disorder, family psychiatric history, family functioning, socioeconomic status, psychosocial adversity, adaptive functioning, and post-injury neurocognitive and adaptive functioning. NPD occurred in 17 of 60 participants (28%) in the 6-12-month interval after injury, with disorders that were significantly associated with socioeconomic status, psychosocial adversity, estimated pre-injury academic functioning, and concurrent deficits in adaptive functioning, academic performance, processing speed, memory, and expressive language. NPD was not significantly associated with pre-injury adaptive functioning, injury severity, family psychiatric history, pre-injury psychiatric disorder, lesion location, gender, or age at injury. These findings suggest that the short-term psychiatric morbidity associated with MTBI in children occurs more commonly than previously reported and is related to both pre-injury social factors and concurrent neurocognitive functioning. © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Few studies have assessed the impact of self-development coaching programs on the students' psychological health. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of a self-development coaching programme on the psychological health and academic performance of preclinical medical and dental students at Umm Al-Qura University, Saudi Arabia. Methods: Four-hundred and twenty-two participants (n = 422, 20-22 years) fulfilled the study requirements and were invited into a parallel-randomised controlled trial that was partially blinded. Participants were stratified by faculty, gender, and academic year, and then randomised. A total of 156 students participated in the intervention group (IG) and 163 students participated in the control group (CG). The IG received the selfdevelopment programme, involving skills and strategies aimed to improve students' psychological health and academic performance, through a two-day workshop. Meanwhile, the CG attended an active placebo programme focussing on theoretical information that was delivered through a five-hour workshop. Both programmes were conducted by the same presenter during Week 1 of the second semester of the 2012-2013 academic year. Data were gathered immediately before (T1), one week after (T2) and five weeks (T3) after the intervention. Psychological health was measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the General Self-Efficacy (GSE), and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Academic performance was measured using students' academic weighted grades (WG). Student cognitive and emotional perceptions of the intervention were measured using the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ). Results: Data from 317 students, who completed the follow ups, were analysed across the three time periods (IG, n = 155; CG, n = 162). The baseline variables and demographic data of the IG and CG were not significantly different. The IG showed short-term significant reductions in depression and anxiety in compared to CG from T1 to T2. The short-term changes in stress, GSE and SWLS of the IG were not significantly different from those of the CG. While both groups showed a significant change on most of the psychological variables from T1 to T3, no significant differences were found between the groups in this period. In addition, no significant difference was found in WG between the IG and CG after the intervention. No harms relevant to the intervention were reported. Conclusion: The investigated self-development coaching programme showed only a short-term improvement on depression and anxiety compared with an active control. There was no effect of the intervention on academic performance.

Our data set included 72,399 adolescents in grades 7-12 who had participated in the 5th Korea Youth Risk Behaviour Web-based Survey (KYRBWS-V) in 2009. We assessed the association between academic performance and body mass index (BMI), using multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjusting for covariates such as age, parents' education level, economic status, mental stress experienced, sleep duration, frequency of muscle-strengthening exercises, smoking and drinking behaviour, and vigorous and moderate physical activity (PA). For boys, being overweight (compared with being of normal weight) had a significantly greater odds of poor academic performance (OR=1.182, 95% CI 1.052-1.329, p=0.005). Obese boys had 1.182 (1.048-1.332, p=0.006), 1.461 (1.294-1.648, p<0.001), and 1.443 (1.256-1.657, p<0.001) greater odds of having average, poor, and very poor performance, respectively. In the analysis for girls, overweight girls had 1.314 (1.124-1.536, p<0.001) and 1.296 (1.084-1.548, p=0.004) greater odds of having poor and very poor academic performance, respectively. Finally, obese girls had 1.374 (1.098-1.718, p=0.005), 1.672 (1.339-2.089, p<0.001), and 1.887 (1.478-2.409, p<0.001) greater odds of having average, poor, or very poor academic performance, respectively. Thus, overweight/obesity was negatively associated with academic performance in both boys and girls. The results of this study indicate that adolescents would benefit from weight management to prevent obesity and, possibly, improve academic performance.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

This integrative review investigates the effectiveness of meditation on psychological problems for adolescents under age of 20 through different types of meditation, though mainly mindfulness-based modes. The 36 reviewed publications include quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods research, conducted in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region, related to developmental disabilities, emotional problems, and mental illnesses. Outcomes indicate a decrease in self-harm thoughts, disruptive behaviour, stress, anxiety, impulsivity, and psychological distress; and improvements in self-control, quality of sleep, emotional regulation, executive function, anger management, and social competence, resulting in better academic performance, quality of life, mental wellness, and child-parent relationships. This review suggests the integration of meditation into physical activities, and music and art therapies, as well as randomised controlled trials to examine such synthesis of these disciplines. In conclusion, meditation is a potential curative and preventive measure, both low cost and non-intrusive, for the promotion of adolescent mental wellness. This sheds light on nurses who look after children with mental health. © 2016 The Author.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Using appropriate extant depression scales to screen for depression and determining factors associated with depression can be helpful in managing it. This study examines the validity and reliability of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for medical students and the relationship between their scores and sociodemographic variables. Methods: This study surveyed 174 medical students using demographic questionnaires, the PHQ-9, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Patient Heath Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). It calculated the Cronbach's α for internal consistency and Pearson's correlation coefficients for test-retest reliability and convergent validity of the PHQ-9. In order to examine the relationship between depression and demographic variables, this study performed independent t tests, one-way analysis of variance, chi-square, and binary logistic regressions. Results: The PHQ-9 was reliable (Cronbach's α = 0.837, test-retest reliability, r = 0.650) and valid (r = 0.509-0.807) when employed with medical students. Total scores on the PHQ-9 were significantly higher among low-perceived academic achievers than among high-perceived academic achievers (p < 0.01). Depression was more prevalent in poor-perceived academic achievers than in high-perceived academic achievers. Similarly, poor-perceived academic achievers were at greater risk of depression than were high-perceived academic achievers (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval] 3.686 [1.092-12.439], p < 0.05). Conclusions: The PHQ-9 has satisfactory reliability and validity in medical students in South Korea. Depression is related to poor-perceived academic achievement when measured with the PHQ-9. Early screening for depression with the PHQ-9 in medical students and providing prompt management to high scorers may not only be beneficial to students' mental health but also improve their academic performance. © 2014 Academic Psychiatry.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The unhealthy behaviours considered were smoking, alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle and irregular breakfast consumption; health outcomes were classified as self-reported health, multiple health complaints and life satisfaction. School environment was measured in terms of liking school, school pressure, academic achievement and classmate support; peer groups were evaluated in terms of the number of peers and frequency of peer contact. Family affluence was measured on a socioeconomic scale.; Results: The total sample comprised 3291 school students: 1135 11-year-olds, 1255 13-year-olds and 901 15-year-olds. Peer group and school environment were associated with unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption and sedentary lifestyle. Family affluence proved to have less impact on unhealthy behaviours, except in the case of adolescents living in low-income families. Poor health outcomes were directly related to a negative school environment. Regarding the influence of family affluence, the results showed higher odds of life dissatisfaction and poor self-reported health status in medium-income families, while low-income families had higher odds only with regard to life dissatisfaction. A consistent pattern of gender differences was found in terms of both unhealthy behaviours and health outcomes.; Conclusions: Unhealthy behaviours are strongly related to the school environment and peer group. A negative school environment proved to have the strongest relation with poor health outcomes. © 2014 Lazzeri et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. Methods.

Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 757 senior high school adolescents who were classified into four groups: Grade 1 (n=261), Grade 2 (n=228), Grade 3T (n=199; Grade 3 students who had another college entrance test to take), and Grade 3S (n=69; Grade 3 students who had succeeded in their college application). Fatigue, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and depression were assessed using the Chinese version of the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory – Short Form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Taiwan Form, the Chinese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Chinese version of the Beck Depression Inventory®-II (BDI-II), respectively. Results: Physical, emotional, and mental fatigue scores were all higher in higher-grade groups. The Grade 3T (test) students had the worst fatigue severity, and the Grade 3S (success) students had the least fatigue severity. More than half of the students (60.9%) went to bed after 12 am, and they had on average 6.0 hours of sleep per night. More than 30% of the students in Grade 2 (37.3%) and Grades 3T/S (30.2%/30.4%) possibly had daily sleepiness problems. The students in Grade 3T had the worst BDI-II score (13.27±9.24), and the Grade 3S students had a much lower BDI-II score (7.91±6.13). Conclusion: Relatively high proportions of fatigue, sleep problems, daytime sleepiness, and depression among senior high school adolescents were found in our study. The severities of fatigue, sleep problems, and depression were significantly diminished in the group under less academic stress (Grade 3S). Our findings may increase the understanding of the mental health of senior high school students under academic pressure in Taiwan. Further large sample size and population-based study should be done for better understanding about this topic. © 2015 Masopust et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This trend has been observed at many universities as mental health issues pose significant problems for many college students. The objective of this study was to investigate potential correlates of depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of college students.; Methods The final analyzed sample consisted of 374 undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 24 attending Franciscan University, Steubenville, Ohio. Subjects completed a survey consisting of demographic questions, a section instructing participants to rate the level of concern associated with challenges pertinent to daily life (e.g. academics, family, sleep), and the 21 question version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21).; Results The results indicated that the top three concerns were academic performance, pressure to succeed, and post-graduation plans. Demographically, the most stressed, anxious, and depressed students were transfers, upperclassmen, and those living off-campus.; Conclusions With the propensity for mental health issues to hinder the success of college students, it is vital that colleges continually evaluate the mental health of their students and tailor treatment programs to specifically target their needs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Methods: All available medical students in the metropolitan city of Daejeon, Korea, were asked to answer self-administered questionnaires from July 1 to July 26 in 2013. A total of 534 medical students participated. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS) and structured questionnaires on related factors were used. Confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach's α were used to verify the applicability of the MBI-SS to medical students in Korea. We also performed chi-square test and logistic regression analysis to identify the factors that were associated with burnout. Results: The MBI-SS was reliable and valid in measuring burnout in Korean medical students. Our confirmatory factor analysis approved and explained the appropriateness of the model fit. The prevalence of burnout among medical students was 26.4% (n=141). Such rates were higher in students who were female, experienced greater levels of depression, had poor academic performance, feared dropping out, and were stressed by the poor quality of the class facilities. Conclusion: The MBI-SS is a valid instrument to measure academic burnout in Korean medical students. Further studies should be performed, because improvements in the mental health of medical students will benefit these doctors-to-be and their future patients. © The Korean Society of Medical Education.

Objective: The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of students' intention to use stimulant medication for the purpose of enhancing their academic performance. Based on an extended model of Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, we examined the predictive value of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, psychological distress, procrastination, substance use, and alcohol use on students' intention to use stimulants to improve their academic performance. Methods: The sample consisted of 3,589 Flemish university and college students (mean age: 21.59, SD: 4.09), who participated anonymously in an online survey conducted in March and April 2013. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the relationships among the study variables. Results: Our results indicate that subjective norm is the strongest predictor of students' intention to use stimulant medication, followed by attitude and perceived behavioral control. To a lesser extent, procrastinating tendencies, psychological distress, and substance abuse contribute to students' intention. Conclusions/ Importance: Based on these findings, we provide several recommendations on how to curtail students' intention to use stimulant medication for the purpose of improving their academic performance. In addition, we urge researchers to identify other psychological variables that might be related to students' intention. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Previous studies have shown that those with backgrounds in the social sciences can be as successful in medical school as those with science backgrounds. However, the experience of being a 'non-science' student over time has not been well described. Methods: A mixed-methods study was developed and run with the aim of elucidating the personal experiences of science and non-science students at our institution. Data were generated from a student survey that focused on participants' self-identification as science or non-science students, and on their sense of preparedness and stress, and from a series of student focus groups exploring participants' experiences of science and non-science issues in all aspects of their training. Descriptive statistics were generated for structured survey data. Focus group data and unstructured survey data were analysed to identify common themes. End-of-module and end-of-year examination data for the four class cohorts in the programme were also analysed to compare science and non-science student performance over time. Results: There were clear differences between the experiences and performance of science and non-science students. We found dichotomies in students' self-reported sense of preparedness and stress levels, and marked differences in their examination performance, which diminished over time to converge around the third year of their studies. Combining science and non-science students in the same class affected the students to different extents and in different ways. The potential disruption of mixing science and non-science students diminished as their levels of performance converged. Conclusions: The psychosocial stress experienced by non-science students and the challenges it posed, in both their academic and their personal lives, have implications for how such students should be supported, and how curricula can be configured to afford quality learning for all medical students. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Three studies showed that when social adversity is common-at the transition to high school-an entity theory can affect overall stress, health, and achievement.

We hypothesised that educational bottlenecks have a negative impact on student wellbeing, and investigated six potential protective factors. Method: A mixed-method approach was used to explore the hitherto unstudied impact of bottlenecks on student wellbeing in a sample of psychology honours students at two time points: at the time of research thesis submission and a month later after grades had been awarded. Results: At the time of submission, honours students experienced high levels of psychological distress and low wellbeing relative to student norms, with 49% scoring in the clinical range for depression. Higher-achieving students had the lowest wellbeing at the time of submission. Wellbeing had improved substantially 1 month later, except among students who received a disappointing grade. Perceived control over academic outcomes and having multiple group memberships from which to draw social support were found to be most important factors for protecting student mental health.

This study evaluated the relationships of these variables with psychological health of first year medical students during stressful periods. A 1-year prospective study was done with students accepted into the School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia. Information on emotional intelligence, GPA and personality traits were obtained prior to admission. The validated Universiti Sains Malaysia Emotional Quotient Inventory and Universiti Sains Malaysia Personality Inventory were used to measure emotional intelligence and personality traits, respectively. Stress, anxiety and depression were measured by the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale during the end-of-course (time 1) and final (time 2) examinations. At the less stressful period (time 1), stress level was associated with agreeableness and the final GPA, anxiety level was associated with emotional control and emotional conscientiousness and depression level was associated with the final GPA and extraversion. At the more stressful period (time 2), neuroticism associated with stress level, anxiety level was associated with neuroticism and emotional expression, and depression level was associated with neuroticism. This study found that neuroticism was the strongest associated factor of psychological health of medical students during their most stressful testing period. Various personality traits, emotional intelligence and previous academic performance were associated factors of psychological health during a less stressful period. These data suggest that early identification of medical students who are vulnerable to the stressful environment of medical schools might help them maintain psychological well-being during medical training.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Acceptance and Mindfulness at Work presents behavioral analysis of human language that’s ready to use, with applied extensions proven to have a significant impact in organizational settings. The leading experts in the field examine how these ongoing developments can help broaden the exploration of the psychological issues relevant to organizational behavioral management (OBM) in the workplace. Acceptance and Mindfulness at Work presents conceptual and empirical articles, and reviews of working examples of Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) applied to organizational behavior management. The book examines goal setting, feedback, task descriptions, and workers’ ability to learn as examples of how to affect positive change in organizations through increased productivity and improved quality of life in the workplace. The possibilities presented by RTF can lead to advancements in employee safety and training, stress and health management, employee evaluation, managing absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover, and self-management. Acceptance and Mindfulness at Work examines: • cognition in OBM • industrial/organization (I/O) psychology • how interventions using ACT have increased psychological flexibility • rule-following feedback • task performance feedback • programmed schedules of reinforcement • goal setting, goal statements, and goal-directed behavior • how psychological flexibility and job control can predict learning, job performance, and mental health • and much more Acceptance and Mindfulness at Work is a vital professional resource for organization development practitioners and human resource managers. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

This chapter will review the research published in the last 10 years on coping skills in adolescence and their association with well-being. Articles were found using the most relevant electronic databases, PubMed, Psychology and Behavioural Science, PsycINFO, Sciencedirect and Scopus, employing various search strategies: the search terms used included MeSH, headings, text words or keywords relevant to the following terms: ""Coping,"" ""adolescent,"" ""well-being,"" ""psychosocial."" Text word and thesaurus searches were used to minimize chances of missing relevant articles. Identified articles were examined for additional references. The search was limited to English-language literature published in the last 10 years (2005- 2015). We considered the full text of the selected papers to examine all the specific characteristics of each study. One of the eligibility criteria was that the papers dealt with adolescents, but we also considered studies where parents were the participants, only when they constituted a source of information about their adolescents' coping strategies and health. We excluded all the articles related to specific health diseases, such as chronic illnesses (cancer, diabetes, etc.) or other specific pathologies, physical, psychiatric or contextual (i.e., eating disorders, sleep deficits, terrorism/emergency events, mental disorders). Some important topics associated with adolescents' psycho-social well-being that emerged from the review of the literature were: Health related quality of life and health beliefs area; Mental well-being area (psychopathology symptoms); Perceived stress and coping strategies to front the daily problems area: SES and coping, stable internal resources, positive coping, coping related to academic performance; Relationship and perceived social support area and Family influences on adolescents' well-being.

Outcomes of interest were quality of life, religiosity, and social functioning in terms of education, occupational status, family structure, and medical treatment history. Results: Lifetime crack cocaine use was associated with poor quality of life, worse functioning, impaired academic performance, and lower religious involvement. A greater maternal presence and higher paternal absence were more also more pronounced in crack cocaine users, who were also more likely to seek psychological and psychiatric treatment than the general population. Conclusion: Quality of life was severely impacted by crack cocaine use, especially in terms of general and physical health.

We then conducted a qualitative exploration of the quantitative results with a subset of students. Next, a set of Expert Panel members participated in qualitative interviews to reflect on and interpret study findings. Overall, we found students experienced high levels of chronic stress, particularly in relation to academic performance and the college admissions process.

We determined if there is any difference in cognitive task performance required for clinical decision-making of healthcare professionals in a quiet compared with noisy environment and to assess the subjective experience of participants with regard to performance in a noisy environment. Methods This was a prospective cross-over study conducted at three academic hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa. 41 doctors involved in the emergency management of patients were administered six matched and prevalidated medical questions over a 30-min period. Each doctor completed half of the questions with exposure to ambient noise (range 40-52 dB(A)) and the other half with exposure to pre-recorded background emergency department noise at 80-85 dB(A). The questions were completed in alternating quiet and noise: half of the physicians answered the odd questions in noise and half answered even numbered questions in noise. Each question was scored out of 10 and the time taken to complete each question was recorded. Results Overall median test scores in quiet and noise were 18.5/30 and 20/30 (p=0.2), respectively; time for test completion was longer in quiet (836 s in quiet and 819 s in noise (p=0.006)). While there was no statistically significant difference in task performance, 65% of the doctors found the noise distracting with 88% experiencing varying degrees of stress.

However biological, interpersonal and environmental influences facilitate or hinder these tendencies and self-actualization efforts. Life-span development is considered as a continuous reordering of selfhood dynamics, which is expected to result in more structured and integrated patterns of internal complexity. Through a person's life-span development, adolescence is considered as an important developmental period because adolescence is a sense of personal identity achievement period which implies the assessments of strengths, weaknesses and the power to deal with them and results in the establishment of a meaningful and satisfying self-concept; a feeling of harmony with self. Behavior problems hinder the adolescents from the acquisition of the developmental tasks, from presenting the expected social roles, from feelings of competence and success and from a successful transition to young adulthood.Person's life affects his/her social circumstances and person's social circumstances affect his/her life. Accordingly, the disruptions in relations with significant others or caregivers affect to emerge in behavior problems. Relations with significant others, relationship between environmental conditions and child/adolescent well-being considered to be important to prevent the development of behavior problems. It has been proved that the perceived availability of social support buffers the effect of stress on psychological distress, depression, and anxiety.This chapter examines and argues the behavior problems of adolescents with respect to perceived social support. In this context, the developmental properties of adolescents and several theories examined adolescence and their contributions to behavior problems are reviewed. Social support and related constructs are indicated in line with the relevant literature. Perceived support from parents, from peers and from teachers are examined seperately. Particularly perceived social support effects on behavioral problems are argued. Gender effect on both behavior problems and perceived social support presented. Additionally a current research conducted by the authors and its results are introduced and discussed.Actually, behavior problems are given through a literatually accepted classification. They are classified as internalizing behavioral problems and externalizing behavioral problems. Internalizing behavioral problems are described under headings as depression/anxiety, social withdrawal, somatic/physical complaints. Externalizing behavior problems are characterized by behaviors that are harmful to others or disruptive indicates and these factors are described under headings as aggression and delinquency. The literature asserts that both developmental properties and social ties precipitate adolescents to develop behavior problems. When one examines fundamental theories, can understand the underlying dynamics more precisely.As a multi-dimensional construct, social support is best understood by including (1) the structure in which supportive transactions take place, (2) the support domains; e.g., emotional, financial, instrumental, informational support and (3) the subjective appraisal of availability and satisfaction with support. The literature offers many; however, most definitions refer to main types of support: emotional, informational, and instrumental that people provide to friends and family members in times of need. Emotional support involves the expression of empathy, reassurance, and positive regard, and is believed to enhance well-being by promoting self-esteem, reducing distress, and providing an emotional context for positive coping efforts. Informational support involves the provision of guidance, advice, or other information that can reduce confusion, increase perceptions of self-efficacy, and form the basis for positive coping strategies. Instrumental support refers to the provision of money, goods, and services that can be used in coping and problem solving efforts.Sources of social support include parents, teachers and peers who are in daily interaction with adolescents and who may provide different influences on their judgments of satisfaction and competence. Parental and peer dynamics and their associations in relation with healthy adolescent functioning are currently receiving much attention.Evidence demonstrates that supportive social relationships have been linked to adolescents' health, morale, and coping, conversely, low levels of social support have been linked to poor physical and mental health outcomes. Perceived social support has been found to be negatively related to behavior problems in adolescents; lower academic performance; lower global functioning. Behavior problems are considered as an important predictor of maladjustment in later life.Within the scope of this chapter, the results of the study conducted by the authors revealed that perceived social support from family, peers and teachers play a crucial role in behavior problems of adolescents, moreover perceived social support from parents make the highest contribution. Certainly, results are consistent with the literature. Consequently, social support is vital for adolescence healthy development especially in this day and time where technology progress quickly, values are discussed, schools and teachers are more demanding, acquiring a profession gets harder, violence is too often seen, adult supervision is reduced due to unmarriages or divorce and proportion of working parents is increased, adolescents become alone vulnerable to threats. Prevention strategies should be school-based and family-based generated and implemented. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

This paper aims to investigate staff's perceptions of patient safety culture in a Danish psychiatric department before and after a leadership intervention. Methods: A repeated cross-sectional experimental study by design was applied. In 2 surveys, healthcare staff were asked about their perceptions of the patient safety culture using the 7 patient safety culture dimensions in the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. To broaden knowledge and strengthen leadership skills, a multicomponent programme consisting of academic input, exercises, reflections and discussions, networking, and action learning was implemented among the clinical area level leaders. Results: In total, 358 and 325 staff members participated before and after the intervention, respectively. 19 of the staff members were clinical area level leaders. In both surveys, the response rate was >75%. The proportion of frontline staff with positive attitudes improved by ≥5% for 5 of the 7 patient safety culture dimensions over time. 6 patient safety culture dimensions became more positive (increase in mean) (p<0.05). Frontline staff became more positive on all dimensions except stress recognition (p<0.05). For the leaders, the opposite was the case (p<0.05). Staff leaving the department after the first measurement had rated job satisfaction lower than the staff staying on (p<0.05). Conclusions: The improvements documented in the patient safety culture are remarkable, and imply that strengthening the leadership can act as a significant catalyst for patient safety culture improvement. Further studies using a longitudinal study design are recommended to investigate the mechanism behind leadership's influence on patient safety culture, sustainability of improvements over time, and the association of change in the patient safety culture measures with change in psychiatric patient safety outcomes. © 2016, BMJ Publishing Group.

After treatment, youth were again randomized and offered an education subsidy immediately (n = 220) or waitlisted (n = 216). Emotion regulation, psychological distress, prosocial attitudes/behaviors, social support, functional impairment, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed at pre- and postintervention and at 6-month follow-up. For youth in school, enrollment, attendance, and classroom performance were assessed after 8 months. Linear mixed-effects regressions evaluated outcomes.; Objective Youth in war-affected regions are at risk for poor psychological, social, and educational outcomes. Effective interventions are needed to improve mental health, social behavior, and school functioning. This randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of a 10-session cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based group mental health intervention for multisymptomatic war-affected youth (aged 15-24 years) in Sierra Leone.; Results The YRI showed significant postintervention effects on emotion regulation, prosocial attitudes/behaviors, social support, and reduced functional impairment, and significant follow-up effects on school enrollment, school attendance, and classroom behavior. In contrast, education subsidy was associated with better attendance but had no effect on mental health or functioning, school retention, or classroom behavior. Interactions between education subsidy and YRI were not significant.; Conclusion YRI produced acute improvements in mental health and functioning as well as longer-term effects on school engagement and behavior, suggesting potential to prepare war-affected youth for educational and other opportunities.

Students on programmes with practicum components such as nursing and teacher education are exposed to additional stressors which may further increase their risk for psychological distress. The ways in which these students cope with distress has potential consequences for their health and academic performance. An in-depth understanding of how nursing/midwifery and teacher education students experience psychological distress and coping is necessary to enable higher education providers to adequately support these students. Methods: This mixed method study was employed to establish self-reported psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire), coping processes (Ways of Coping Questionnaire) and lifestyle behaviour (Lifestyle Behaviour Questionnaire) of a total sample (n=1557) of undergraduate nursing/midwifery and teacher education students in one university in Ireland. Individual interviews (n=59) provided an in-depth understanding of students experiences of psychological distress and coping. Results: A significant percentage (41.9%) of respondents was psychologically distressed. The factors which contributed to their distress, included study, financial, living and social pressures. Students used varied coping strategies including seeking social support, problem solving and escape avoidance. The positive relationship between elevated psychological distress and escape avoidance behaviours including substance use (alcohol, tobacco and cannabis) and unhealthy diet is of particular concern. Statistically significant relationships were identified between ""escape-avoidance"" and gender, age, marital status, place of residence, programme/year of study and lifestyle behaviours such as diet, substance use and physical inactivity. Conclusion: The paper adds to existing research by illuminating the psychological distress experienced by undergraduate nursing/midwifery and teacher education students. It also identifies their distress, maladaptive coping and the relationship to their lifestyle behaviours. The findings can inform strategies to minimise student distress and maladaptive coping during college and in future professional years. © 2014 Deasy et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Purpose: The goal of the study was to test the efficacy of the COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment) Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Emotions, Exercise, Nutrition) Program, versus an attention control program (Healthy Teens) on: healthy lifestyle behaviors, BMI, mental health, social skills, and academic performance of high school adolescents immediately after and at 6 months post-intervention. Design: A cluster RCT was conducted. Data were collected from January 2010 to May of 2012 and analyzed in 2012-2013. Setting/participants: A total of 779 culturally diverse adolescents in the U.S. Southwest participated in the trial. Intervention: COPE was a cognitive-behavioral skills-building intervention with 20 minutes of physical activity integrated into a health course, taught by teachers once a week for 15 weeks. The attention control program was a 15-session, 15-week program that covered common health topics. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes assessed immediately after and 6 months post-intervention were healthy lifestyle behaviors and BMI. Secondary outcomes included mental health, alcohol and drug use, social skills, and academic performance. Results: Post-intervention, COPE teens had a greater number of steps per day (p=0.03) and a lower BMI (p=0.01) than did those in Healthy Teens, and higher average scores on all Social Skills Rating System subscales (p-values <0.05). Teens in the COPE group with extremely elevated depression scores at pre-intervention had significantly lower depression scores than the Healthy Teens group (p=0.02). Alcohol use was 12.96% in the COPE group and 19.94% in the Healthy Teens group (p=0.04). COPE teens had higher health course grades than did control teens. At 6 months post-intervention, COPE teens had a lower mean BMI than teens in Healthy Teens (COPE=24.72, Healthy Teens=25.05, adjusted M=-0.34, 95% CI=-0.56, -0.11). The proportion of those overweight was significantly different from pre-intervention to 6-month follow-up (chi-square=4.69, p=0.03), with COPE decreasing the proportion of overweight teens, versus an increase in overweight in control adolescents. There also was a trend for COPE Teens to report less alcohol use at 6 months (p=0.06). Conclusions: COPE can improve short- and more long-term outcomes in high school teens. © 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The degree to which high fidelity simulation elicits acute emotional and physiologic stress among participants - and the influence of acute stress on clinical performance in the simulation setting - remain areas of active exploration. We examined the relationship between residents' self-reported anxiety and a proxy of physiologic stress (heart rate) as well as their clinical performance in a simulation exam using a validated assessment of non-technical skills, the Ottawa Crisis Resource Management Global Rating Scale (Ottawa GRS). Methods. This was a prospective observational cohort study of emergency medicine residents at a single academic center. Participants managed a simulated clinical encounter. Anxiety was assessed using a pre- and post-simulation survey, and continuous cardiac monitoring was performed on each participant during the scenario. Performance in the simulation scenario was graded by faculty raters using a critical actions checklist and the Ottawa GRS instrument. Results: Data collection occurred during the 2011 academic year. Of 40 eligible residents, 34 were included in the analysis. The median baseline heart rate for participants was 70 beats per minute (IQR: 62 - 78). During the simulation, the median maximum heart rate was 140 beats per minute (IQR: 137 - 151). The median minimum heart rate during simulation was 81 beats per minute (IQR: 72 - 92), and mean heart rate was 117 beats per minute (95% CI: 111 - 123). Pre- and post-simulation anxiety scores were equal (mean 3.3, IQR: 3 to 4). The minimum and maximum Overall Ottawa GRS scores were 2.33 and 6.67, respectively. The median Overall score was 5.63 (IQR: 5.0 to 6.0). Of the candidate predictors of Overall performance in a multivariate logistic regression model, only PGY status showed statistical significance (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Simulation is associated with physiologic stress, and heart rate elevation alone correlates poorly with both perceived stress and performance. Non-technical performance in the simulation setting may be more closely tied to one's level of clinical experience than to perceived or actual stress. © 2014 Clarke et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the rigors of professional education can be demanding. Stress, depression, and anxiety (SDA) can interfere with learning, affect academic performance, and impair clinical practice performance. Studies report a general increase in the severity of and extent of mental health problems among college/university students. The literature regarding nursing students' mental health distress identifies academic and personal sources of stress and coping efforts, with emphasis on the stress and anxiety associated with clinical practice. This cross-sectional descriptive exploratory study investigated levels of SDA among nursing students in 3 years of a university- based program. The association between quality of life indicators including known stressors, such as financial concerns and balance between school and personal life, and SDA was also investigated. Through an online survey, 437 participants fromonemid-western Canadian undergraduate nursing program completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and provided data on quality of life indicators and demographic information. Participants also were invited to provide narrative data about their experiences with SDA. This article will present significant findings including: levels of SDA; comparisons between our sample and a normative sample on the dimensions of SDA; and the results of multiple regression analysis identifying significant predictors of each dimension. Themes from the qualitative comments from 251 of the participants were identified and added depth and clarity to the quantitative findings.

However, there are very few studies exploring on the psychological health of prospective medical students. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors for stress, anxiety and depression symptoms among the prospective medical students. A cross-sectional study was done on two cohorts of applicants to a public medical school. A total of 839 applicants were invited to participate in the study. The 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale was administered to the applicants after they completed interviews. A total of 743 (92.2%) applicants took part in the study. The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe level of stress, anxiety and depression were 3.6%, 54.5% and 1.9%, respectively. Stress was significantly associated with extra-curricular activity (p<. 0.001) and race (p<. 0.001). Anxiety was associated with extra-curricular activity (p<. 0.001), race (p<. 0.001), mother education level (p=0.002) and CGPA group (p=0.034). Depression was associated with academic performance in class (p<. 0.001) and race (p=0.004). Prevalence of stress and depression among entering medical students was low; however prevalence of anxiety was high which could be due to worry about the interviews to enter medical course. The associated factors of psychological distress among prospective medical students were related to academic, non-academic, parent education and cultural backgrounds. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Few studies consider the moderating effects of parental and peer influence within the context of adolescent work outside of the school environment. This study aims to examine work stress among adolescents and the association with alcohol use and drunkenness, in the context of parental and peer influences. Methods: Grade 12 students who participated in Monitoring the Future surveys between 2005 and 2009 (n = 12,341) were included in this study. Independent variables included work stress (job satisfaction, perceived safety, and perceived safety of possessions), self-reported perceptions towards academics and influence from parents and peers. Frequency of alcohol use and drunkenness were measured for lifetime, last 30 days and 12 months. The moderating effects of academic aspiration, parental, and peer influence were assessed on the relationship between work stress and alcohol use. Results: Any work stress was positively associated with alcohol use over the past 12 months (odds ratio = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.23). Stratified analysis found that peer influence significantly moderated the relationship between work stress and alcohol use over the lifetime and past 12 months. Among adolescents with work stress, odds ratios of alcohol use over the lifetime was 0.83 (95% CI 0.71-0.97) for those with low negative peer influence and 1.09 (95% CI 0.97-1.22) for those with high negative peer influence. Conclusions: Problematic drinking patterns were more apparent among high school students who experienced stress at work. Positive peer influence, however, may buffer the adverse effect of work stress on alcohol use. © 2014 Liu et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Using structural equation modeling, the authors tested a theoretical model suggesting that psychological distress and student engagement mediate the association between the experience of victimization and concurrent academic achievement. Participants were 469 (46.4 % male, 53.6 % female) 6th to 8th grade students, from randomly selected classrooms in 11 middle schools in a southeastern school district. Structural equation models of the hypothesized effects demonstrated adequate fit to the data, with both symptoms of psychological distress and engagement mediating the relationship between victimization and academic achievement. In general, the results suggest that victimization predicts diminished academic achievement by way of psychological distress and poorer engagement in classroom and academic tasks. However, the direct relationship between victimization and measures of achievement lacked significance across many correlational and path analyses conducted.

In the recent time several research findings brings the fact that studying and training as a formative period gives a significant contribution to further occurrence of burnout in medical profession. Aim: We assessed the influences of academic stress and the adverse effects in the form of psychological distress and burnout syndrome in medical students. Methods: This study was in the form of a voluntary anonymous questionnaire, contained: socio-demographic data, self-reported health status and influences of studying activities conducted on 380 medical students who attended the final year. Mental health status was estimated by: General Health Questionnaire - GHQ-12 and Maslach Burnout Inventory - MBI. Results: About 50% females and one-third of male students (p= 0.01) assessed their general stress level as moderate or high. Exams were cited as a highstressor in about 50% of all, frequently in female students (p< 0.001). Stressful effects of communication with teaching staff was reported frequently by males (p < 0.001), while contacts with patients were considered to be stressful by female students (p = 0.011). The scores of GHQ-12 questionnaire were above the threshold in 54%, with values higher in females (p = 0.028). High scores were found among 58% in subscale of Depersonalization, and 38.8% on a subscale of Emotional exhaustion MBI. Stressful effect of the exams, contact with patients and teaching staff correlate significantly with scores of GHQ-12 and scores of Emotional exhaustion and Depersonalization of MBI. Conclusion: The prevalence of burnout among the medical students at the and of studying highlighted the importance of modifying the curriculum for better overcoming of stressful influence medical training. Effective measures of stress reduction would be targeted to the optimization of the exams, communication improving, and the development of practical skills. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

Because of better conditions in diagnosis and early medical and surgical treatment, patients have survival rates of 90% and go further and further in life, facing different challenges in life cycle. In this study, we tested the effects of different demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables on the perception of quality of life (QOL), on psychosocial adjustment (PSA) and psychiatric morbidity (PM) of adolescents and young adults with CHD. We aimed to evaluate QOL, PM and PSA of adolescents and young adults with CHD and to determine which variables (demographic, clinical, and psychosocial) play a role in buffering stress and promoting resilience and which ones have a detrimental effect. Methods The study enrolled 150 CHD patients (87 males and 63 females), 12 to 26 years (17.45±3.373 years). The participants were interviewed regarding social support, family educational style, self-image, demographic information and physical limitations. They responded to questions in a standardized psychiatric interview (SADS-L) and completed self-reports questionnaires for assessment of QOL (WHOQOL-BREF) and PSA (YSR/ASR). Results We found a 18.7% lifetime prevalence of psychopathology in our participants (25.4% in females and 13.8% in males). 57.1% had retentions in school (1.53±0.804 year). The perception of QOL of CHD patients is better compared to the Portuguese population in the social relationships, environmental, physical and general dimensions. However, it is worse in female CHD patients and patients with poor academic performance and social support as well as in patients with complex or cyanotic CHD, moderate-to-severe residual lesions and physical limitations, and undergoing surgery. All of these variables, except presence of cyanosis, are also associated to a worse PSA. Conclusions Female patients and patients with poor academic performance and poor social support refer worse PSA and QOL.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

While there is considerable quantitative research on this issue, no systematic effort has been made to assess the deeper reasons behind student decision making through a mixed-methods approach. This article seeks to explore the prevalence, correlates and potential reasons for rural dropout throughout the secondary education process. It brings together results from eight large-scale survey studies covering 24,931 rural secondary students across four provinces, as well as analysis of extensive interviews with 52 students from these same study sites. The results show that the cumulative dropout rate across all windows of secondary education may be as high as 63 per cent. Dropping out is significantly correlated with low academic performance, high opportunity cost, low socio-economic status and poor mental health. A model is developed to suggest that rural dropout is primarily driven by two mechanisms: rational cost-benefit analysis or impulsive, stress-induced decision making. © 2015 The China Quarterly.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Compared to singleton pregnancy, medical and health care services and questions related to the socio-emotional and educational development are of special importance. This includes that the development of a unique personality is influenced by the presence of a same-aged sibling. Also, parents are often confronted with twins' different performances in school or in language development and those differences are perceived as more pronounced than in normal sibling pairs. Finally, the parents themselves often face a double physical and mental pressure. The task of the pediatrician should therefore not only cover the twins' medical care. They can also provide targeted advice for reducing parental stress and help with critical decisions, for example with regard to school enrollment. In this respect, it is also important for the pediatrician to evaluate the development and competences of the twins not in relation to each other but rather compared to their peers.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of 45 decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants versus 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to 45 dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes. Objectives: Primary objective To determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates. Secondary objectives 1. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity). 2. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age. 3. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance. 4. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings 2000 to 2014 (Abstracts2ViewTM), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November 2014. Selection criteria: Preterm infants (< 32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or < 1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit. Data collection and analysis: We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results: One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of < 48 hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been > 48 hours old. There was no significant difference in weight at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (MD) 111 g (95% confidence interval (CI) -151 to 374 g) (n = 23). There was no significant difference in weight at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.31 kg, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16 kg (n = 14). There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87 (n = 12), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD -2.16, 95% CI -18.44 to 14.12 (n =12). Authors' conclusions: To date, only 34 infants have been enrolled in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of reducing sound levels that reach the infants' ears in the NICU. Based on the small sample size of this single trial, we cannot make any recommendations for clinical practice. Larger, well designed, conducted and reported trials are needed. © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

In addition to the normal stressors of everyday life, students must deal with stresses related to their education. Our aim was to identify the mental health status of university students and its correlation with socio-demographic, academic performance, and menstrual features. Design: A cross sectional study was conducted among undergraduate health students using the Symptoms Checklist-90- Revised (SCL-90-R). The Global Severity Index (GSI), raw scores of SCL-90-R subscales, and correlated factors were reported and analyzed. Results: A total of 171 health students completed the survey. Psychopathological symptoms were found in 23% of the student. Depression was the most prevalent mental reported symptom (100%). There was no significant association between the symptoms and variables such as age, gender, living in university dormitories, marital status, field of study, academic performance, and the day of menstrual cycle while filling the form. GSI scores were significantly related to regular menses. The odds of being identified as a mentally unhealthy individual was 0.37 times lower for those who experienced regular menstrual cycles. Conclusion: Psychological distress is prevalent among health students and tends to be reported more by female students with irregular periods and during luteal phase of menstrual cycle. Preventive and treatment programs need to be developed. It is also recommended that SCL-90-R be administered at least 7 days after the end of menstrual bleeding. © 2015 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The present study was the first to quantitatively assess the short- and long-term impact of bar coded medication administration (BCMA) IT on nurses' mental workload as well as on perceived medication safety. One-hundred seventy registered nurses across 3 dissimilar clinical units at an academic, freestanding pediatric hospital in the Midwest US participated in surveys administered before, 3 months after, and 12 months after the hospital implemented BCMA. Nurses rated their external mental workload (interruptions, divided attention, being rushed) and internal mental workload (concentration, mental effort) during medication administration tasks as well as the likelihood of each of three medication safety events: medication administration errors, medication errors on the clinical unit, and clinical unit-level adverse drug events. Clinical unit differences were assessed. Findings generally confirmed the hypothesis that external but not internal mental workload was associated with the perceived likelihood of a medication safety event. Comparisons of mental workload from pre- to post-BCMA revealed statistically significant changes in the critical care unit only. Medication safety appeared to improve over the long term in the hematology/oncology unit only. In the critical care and medical/surgical units, medication safety exhibited short-term improvements that were eliminated over time. Changes in mental workload and medication safety, two classically microergonomic constructs, were deeply embedded in macroergonomic phenomena. These included the fit between the BCMA system and the nature of nursing work, the process of BCMA implementation, and BCMA interactions with concurrent changes occurring in the hospital. Findings raise questions about achieving sustainable performance improvement with health IT as well as the balance between micro- and macroergonomic approaches to studying technology change. Relevance to industry: Designers must consider how technology changes cognitive work, including mental workload. Hospitals and other implementers of technology must ensure that new technology fits its users, their tasks, and the context of use, which may entail tailoring implementation, for example, to specific clinical units. Evaluators must look over time to assess both changes in cognitive work and implementation issues. Healthcare practitioners must also recognize that new technology means a complex transformation to an already complex sociotechnical system, which calls for a macroergonomic approach to design and analysis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Materials and Methods: A total of 366 (181 girls and 185 boys) adolescents with gross dental malocclusion were selected for the study group. A modified oral aesthetic subjective impact scale questionnaire was applied in face-to-face interviews. Similar data were collected from parents, schoolteachers and one friend of each adolescent selected for the study. Academic performance was evaluated from school records and compared with a control group of 400 adolescents (200 girls and 200 boys) having normal occlusion and an aesthetically pleasing facial appearance. The Kruskal-Wallis H and chi-square tests were used to analyse the data. The correlation between the academic performance of adolescents and the psychological impact of malocclusion was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation. Results: Significant numbers of adolescents (81.1%) were concerned about the appearance of their teeth, with significant gender variation (0.02). 88.5% of the adolescents received comments from others about their appearance. The results differed significantly by gender for 'avoiding smiling' (p = 0.02) and 'participation in social activities' (p = 0.02). The evaluation of academic performance showed that 42.1% of the adolescents with gross dental malocclusion performed below average; this also differed statistically significantly by gender (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Untreated gross dental malocclusion significantly affects the psychosocial well-being of adolescents, who may avoid participating in social activities and tend to underperform in school. © Quintessenz all rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

During young adulthood (Wave 4), respondents ranged in age from 19 to 32. The results demonstrated unique long-term influences of stressful marital history typologies of mothers (prior to 1995) on the physical and mental health of young adults (2008) with reference to consistently married mothers after controlling for health status in 2001. These influences operated through family processes (economic pressure and parental rejection) and adolescent psychosocial adjustment (self-esteem, academic performance, and delinquent behavior).

In South Africa, black adolescents are faced with many stressors and challenges which are placing demands on their emotional and cognitive resources. Aims: The aim of this study was to determine whether black South African adolescents with different cognitive styles (i.e. rational or experiential) differ in their levels of stress and coping. Furthermore, the common stressors that black adolescents experience and the coping styles predominantly used by black adolescents could be determined. Methods: One hundred and eighty-seven participants (88 males and 99 females) completed the Rational Experiential, the Coping Reponses and the Adolescent Stress Inventory. Results: Adolescents operating from an experiential cognitive style experienced more stress regarding school performance, school attendance, financial pressure and emerging adult responsibility than adolescents operating from a rational cognitive style. Adolescents employing a rational style sought more alternative rewards as a coping strategy, whereas adolescents employing an experiential style relied more on emotional discharge. Conclusions: The findings of this study concur with previous research, but provide a unique perspective on adolescents' stress and coping in this South African context. © 2014 Shadowfax Publishing and Informa UK Limited.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

As hypothesized, skill-training programs that included a supervised practice component were significantly more effective overall (mean effect size = 0.45, confidence interval (CI) = 0.39 to 0.52) compared to skill-training programs without supervised practice (0.11, CI = −0.01 to 0.22) and psychoeducational (information-only) programs (0.13, CI = 0.06 to 0.21). When comparisons on specific outcomes were possible, skill-training programs including supervised practice were significantly more effective than the other two groups of programs in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and general psychological distress, and in improving social-emotional skills, self-perceptions, and academic behaviors and performance. The magnitude of effects achieved in several outcome areas is comparable to or higher than that reported in other reviews of universal programs, suggesting that skill-training programs for higher education students that incorporate supervised practice now join the ranks of other effective preventive mental health interventions.

Twenty-one independent studies that assessed the efficacy of expressive writing on youth samples aged 10-18. years were collected and analyzed. Results indicated an overall mean g-effect size that was positive in direction but relatively small (0.127), as well as significant g-effect sizes ranging from 0.107 to 0.246 for the outcome domains of emotional distress, Problem Behavior, Social Adjustment, and School Participation. Few significant effects were found within specific outcome domains for putative moderator variables that included characteristics of the participants, intervention instructions, or research design. Studies involving adolescents with high levels of emotional problems at baseline reported larger effects on school performance. Studies that implemented a higher dosage intervention (i.e., greater number and, to some extent, greater spacing of sessions) reported larger effects on somatic complaints. Overall, the findings suggest that expressive writing tends to produce small yet significant improvements on adolescents' well-being. The findings highlight the importance of modifying the traditional expressive writing protocol to enhance its efficacy and reduce potential detrimental effects.

Forty-three percent of students were energy drink (ED) users; 45% of these were regular ED users. OTC medication users had significantly higher stress scores than non-OTC medication users, and ED users had significantly higher anxiety scores than non-ED users. The most common reasons for use given by OTC medication users were to help with studying and to fall asleep at night. Depression scores were significantly higher for juniors and sophomores than for freshmen. Depression, stress, and anxiety scores were all lower in the Colorado State University students when compared with the University of Georgia students. OTC medication and ED veterinary student users had distinct characteristics that differed from those of nonusers. Users suffered from more stress and anxiety and had more difficulties with sleep, which may have affected their overall health and academic performance. Educating veterinary students about the consequences of using OTC medication and ED and providing counseling support may be of benefit to veterinary students' psychological well-being.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of expressed emotion as a proximal factor for depression and antisocial behavior among adolescents, by looking at direct and indirect relationships. Methods: Secondary data analysis using path analysis was carried out on 2004 data from the Child and Adolescent Behaviors in Long-term Evaluation project. The study sample consisted of 1599 seventh-grade students in Northern Taiwan. Variables included family factors, personal factors (sex and academic performance), expressed emotion [emotional involvement (EI) and perceived criticism (PC)], depression, and antisocial behavior. Results: We found that one dimension of expressed emotion, PC, directly influenced student depression and related indirectly to antisocial behavior. Depression was an important mediator between PC and antisocial behavior. Another dimension, EI, did not influence either depression or antisocial behavior. Sex was related directly to expressed emotion, depression, and antisocial behavior, and also indirectly to antisocial behavior through PC and depression. Academic performance was related directly to expressed emotion and indirectly to antisocial behavior through PC and depression. Conclusion: Greater PC from parents directly contributed to higher levels of student depression and was related indirectly to more student antisocial behavior. It is suggested that parents should decrease overly critical parenting styles to promote adolescent mental health and avoid the development of antisocial behavior. © 2010 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Empirical studies covering individual, relationship, community, and societal factors associated with adolescent gambling problems are reviewed. The cumulative body of research suggests that males who are exposed to gambling at an earlier age are at greater risk of developing gambling problems. Individuals who report poor family cohesion, have family members or friends who also gamble, and those exposed to and engaged in a wider variety of gambling options are at greater risk. Adolescents with impulsive, high sensation-seeking personalities and exhibit emotion-focused coping styles are more likely to experience gambling problems. Anxiety, depression, ADHD, poor academic performance, substance use, and delinquency are also strong predictors. Many of these risk factors appear to predict a general behavior syndrome encompassed by overall mental health problems, substance abuse, delinquency, and problem gambling. Increased exposure to gambling opportunities and marketing of gambling is recognized as a potential risk factor at a community level while gambling-permissive cultures may instill positive attitudes and beliefs toward gambling. A call is made for more research that can identify the causal risk factors that lead to gambling problems among youth which will ultimately improve our prevention efforts. ©Freund Publishing House Ltd.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Although prior studies reported pediatric drug-dosing mistakes and other types of management errors, the underlying causes of those errors were not investigated. The objective of this study was to identify causes of errors during a simulated, prehospital pediatric emergency. Methods: Two-person emergency medical services (EMS) crews from five geographically diverse agencies participated in a validated simulation of an infant with altered mental status, seizures, and respiratory arrest using their own equipment and drugs. A scoring protocol was used to identify errors. A debriefing conducted by a trained facilitator immediately after the simulated event elicited root causes of active and latent errors, which were analyzed by thematic qualitative assessment methods. Results: Forty-five crews completed the study. Clinically important themes that emerged from the data included oxygen delivery, equipment organization and use, glucose measurement, drug administration, and inappropriate cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Delay in delivery of supplemental oxygen resulted from two different automaticity errors and a 54% failure rate in using an oropharyngeal airway (OPA). Most crews struggled to locate essential pediatric equipment. Three found broken or inoperable bag/valve/masks (BVMs), resulting in delayed ventilation. Some mistrusted their intraosseous (IO) injection gun device; others used it incorrectly. Only 51% of crews measured blood glucose; some discovered that glucometers were not stored in their sealed pediatric bags. The error rate for diazepam dosing was 47%; for midazolam, it was 60%. Underlying causes of dosing errors were found in four domains (cognitive, procedural, affective, and teamwork), and they included incorrect estimates of weight, incorrect use of the Broselow pediatric emergency tape, faulty recollection of doses, difficulty with calculations under stress, mg/kg to mg to mL conversion errors, inaccurate measurement of volumes, use of the wrong end of prefilled syringes, and failure to crosscheck doses with partners. Conclusions: Simulation, followed immediately by facilitated debriefing, uncovered underlying causes of active cognitive, procedural, affective, and teamwork errors, latent errors, and error-producing conditions in EMS pediatric care. © 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Specifically, the current longitudinal study examines relations between a contextual risk factor (ie, family life stressors), an asthma-related risk factor (ie, asthma symptoms), individual resources (ie, attention, children's problem-solving beliefs, and self-esteem), and aspects of asthma morbidity that have been shown to have an impact on children's academic performance. Participants of the study included 31 mother-child dyads from low-income, inner-city neighborhoods. Results of hierarchical regression analyses revealed that after controlling for risk factors (ie, asthma symptoms and family life stressors) at baseline, children's individual characteristics (ie, children's problem-solving beliefs and self-esteem) functioned as resource factors for some indices of asthma-related functioning (school absences, participation in activities, and missed sleep) at follow-up (1 year later).

Methods: AU registered graduate students in the Spring 2004 semester received an e-mail invitation to participate in a Web survey. Of the 3,121 completed surveys, 551 completed surveys were from international graduate students. Results: Approximately 44% of international graduate students responded that they had had an emotional or stress-related problem that significantly affected their well-being or academic performance within the past year. International students who reported a more functional relationship with their advisors were less likely to report having an emotional or stress-related problem in the past year and using counseling services. International students who reported higher financial confidence were also less likely to use counseling services. Conclusions: There is an unmet mental health need among international graduate students. Special mental health outreach efforts should be directed at international graduate students, with particular attention on the relationship between students and their advisors and on adequate financial support for students.

In recent years there has been a growing appreciation of the issues of quality of life and stresses involved medical training as this may affect their learning and academic performance. However, such studies are lacking in medical schools of Nepal. Therefore, we carried out this study to assess the prevalence of psychological morbidity, sources and severity of stress and coping strategies among medical students in our integrated problem-stimulated undergraduate medical curriculum. Methods. A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey was carried out among the undergraduate medical students of Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara, Nepal during the time period August, 2005 to December, 2006. The psychological morbidity was assessed using General Health Questionnaire. A 24-item questionnaire was used to assess sources of stress and their severity. Coping strategies adopted was assessed using brief COPE inventory. Results. The overall response rate was 75.8% (407 out of 525 students). The overall prevalence of psychological morbidity was 20.9% and was higher among students of basic sciences, Indian nationality and whose parents were medical doctors. By logistic regression analysis, GHQ-caseness was associated with occurrence of academic and health-related stressors. The most common sources of stress were related to academic and psychosocial concerns. The most important and severe sources of stress were staying in hostel, high parental expectations, vastness of syllabus, tests/exams, lack of time and facilities for entertainment. The students generally used active coping strategies and alcohol/drug was a least used coping strategy. The coping strategies commonly used by students in our institution were positive reframing, planning, acceptance, active coping, self-distraction and emotional support. The coping strategies showed variation by GHQ-caseness, year of study, gender and parents' occupation. Conclusion. The higher level of psychological morbidity warrants need for interventions like social and psychological support to improve the quality of life for these medical students. Student advisors and counselors may train students about stress management. There is also need to bring about academic changes in quality of teaching and evaluation system. A prospective study is necessary to study the association of psychological morbidity with demographic variables, sources of stress and coping strategies. © 2007 Sreeramareddy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Major depression is a prevalent mental disorder in the general population, with a multi-factorial etiology. However, work stress as a risk factor for major depression has not been well studied. Method. Using a longitudinal study design, this analysis investigated the association between the levels of work stress and major depressive episode(s) in the Canadian working population, aged 18 to 64 years. Data from the longitudinal cohort of the Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) were used (n = 6663). The NPHS participants who did not have major depressive episodes (MDE) at baseline (1994-1995 NPHS) were classified into four groups by the quartile values of the baseline work stress scores. The proportion of MDE of each group was calculated using the 1996-1997 NPHS data. Results. The first three quartile groups had a similar risk of MDE. Those who had a work stress score above the 75th percentile had an elevated risk of MDE (7.1%). Using the 75th percentile as a cut-off, work stress was significantly associated with the risk of MDE in multivariate analysis (odds ratio = 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.54-3.77). Other factors associated with MDE in multivariate analysis included educational level, number of chronic medical illnesses and child and adulthood traumatic events. There was no evidence of effect modification between work stress and selected sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables. Conclusions. Work stress is an independent risk factor for the development of MDE in the working population. Strategies to improve working environment are needed to keep workers mentally healthy and productive. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Students leaving their hometown and family at a young age to pursue better educational opportunities overseas are confronted with life adjustment stress, which in turn affects their mental health and academic performance. This study aimed to examine the relationships among stress, coping strategies, and depressive symptoms using the stress coping framework in overseas Chinese university preparatory students in Taiwan. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted at an overseas Chinese university preparatory institute in Taiwan. Of enrolled overseas Chinese university preparatory students at 2009, 756 completed a structured questionnaire measuring stress, strategies for coping with it, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: High levels of stress significantly predicted the adoption of active, problem-focused coping strategies (R2 = 0.13, p < .01) and passive, emotion-focused coping strategies (R2 = 0.24, p < .01). Acceptable CFI, SRMR, and RMSEA values from the structural equation modeling analysis demonstrated that the model satisfactorily fits the stress coping framework, after active coping strategies were eliminated from the model. Results from the Sobel test revealed that passive coping strategies mediated the relation between stress and depressive symptoms (z = 8.06, p < .001). Conclusion: Our study results suggested that stress is associated with coping strategies and depressive symptoms and passive strategies mediate the relation between stress and depressive symptoms in overseas Chinese university preparatory students. © 2011 Chou et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

It may affect academic performance and lead to anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and burnouts. There is limited data on stress in Indian medical students. We conducted an analytical observational study to assess the magnitude of stress and identify possible stressors in medical students of a teaching hospital in Kolkata. Materials And Methods: This questionnaire-based study was conducted in the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata with consenting undergraduate students of 3 rd , 6 th , and 9 th (final) semesters, during lecture classes in individual semesters on a particular day. The students were not informed about the session beforehand and were assured of confidentiality. The first part of the questionnaire captured personal and interpersonal details which could be sources of stress. The rest comprised three rating scales-the 28-item General Health Questionnaire to identify the existence of stress, the Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being scale to assess the mental well-being, and the revised version of the Lubben social network scale to assess the social networking. The responses and scores were compared between the three semesters as well as between various subgroups based on baseline characteristics. Results: Data from 215 respondents were analyzed-approximately 75% were male, 45% came from rural background, 25% from low-income families, and 60% from vernacular medium. Totally, 113 (52.56%; 95% confidence interval: 43.35-61.76%) students were found to be stressed, without significant difference in stress incidence between the semesters. About 60% of the female students were stressed in contrast to 50% of the males, but this observed difference was not statistically significant. The mental well-being and social networking of stressed respondents suffered in comparison to their non-stressed counterparts. Conclusions: The stress incidence in medical students in this institution in India is high and is negatively affecting their mental well-being. Further multicentric and longitudinal studies are needed to explore the incidence, causes, and consequences of stress in our setting.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Although the second Chinese version of the Occupational Stress Indicator (OSI-2) is commonly used in research, questions about workload for medical workers are not included. Hence, we followed the format of the OSI-2 and designed a questionnaire to assess medical workers' stress (QMWS). The reliability and validity of the QMWS were examined. Methods: There are eight questions in the QMWS, as follows: 1) running the hospital, 2) preparing the hospital for accreditation, 3) maintaining patients' disease conditions, 4) maintaining a good relationship with patients, 5) managing medical disputes or lawsuits, 6) paying employees' salaries, 7) having a good job performance, and 8) seeking a job promotion or doing academic research. Results: The average rating by 13 experts of the QMWS was > 4. The two-week test-retest reliability was 0.85. The correlation coefficient, r, between the QMWS and the source of stress in the OSI-2 was between 0.48 and 0.67. Emotional exhaustion and depersonalization according to the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Health Service Survey (MBI-HSS) served as a convergent validity and a significant r (0.37 and 0.16, respectively) was observed. Job satisfaction, physical health, and mental health in the OSI-2, and personal accomplishment in the MBI-HSS, served as a divergent validity and a significant r (-0.31 to -0.38) existed. The Cronbach's alpha for the QMWS was 0.84. Conclusions: The QMWS has a good content, concurrent criteria, construct validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistence. We welcome other researchers to use the QMWS so that findings can be compared on the same basis.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The most common mental health consequences are depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, medically unexplained somatic symptoms, and stigma. The excess morbidity rate of psychiatric disorders in the first year after a disaster is in the order of 20%. Disasters involving radiation are particularly pernicious because the exposure is invisible and universally dreaded, and can pose a long-term threat to health. After the Chernobyl disaster, studies of clean-up workers (liquidators) and adults from contaminated areas found a two-fold increase in post-traumatic stress and other mood and anxiety disorders and significantly poorer subjective ratings of health. Among liquidators, the most important risk factor was severity of exposure. In general population samples, the major risk factor was perceived exposure to harmful levels of radiation. These findings are consistent with results from A-bomb survivors and populations studied after the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident. With regard to children, apart from findings from ecological studies that lack direct data on radiation or other teratologic exposures and local studies in Kiev, the epidemiologic evidence suggests that neither radiation exposure nor the stress of growing up in the shadow of the accident was associated with emotional disorders, cognitive dysfunction, or impaired academic performance. Thus, based on the studies of adults, the Chernobyl Forum concluded that mental health was the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident. Since mental health is a leading cause of disability, physical morbidity, and mortality, health monitoring after radiation accidents like Fukushima should include standard measures of well-being. Moreover, given the comorbidity of mental and physical health, the findings support the value of training non-psychiatrist physicians in recognizing and treating common mental health problems like depression in Fukushima patients. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

One study also reported that relative age within a school year is an independent risk factor for emotional and behavioral problems. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that relatively younger adolescents in the multiethnic population of Oslo have poorer school performance and more mental health problems than their relatively older classmates within the same school year. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study included all 10th-grade pupils enrolled in 2000 and 2001 in the city of Oslo. The participation rate was 88%. Of the 6,752 pupils in the study sample, 25% had a non-Norwegian background. Mental health problems were quantified using the abbreviated versions of Symptom Check List-25 (SCL-10) and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Information on school performances and mental health problems were self-reported. We controlled for confounding factors including parental educational level, social support, gender, and ethnicity. Results: The youngest one-third of pupils had significantly lower average school grades than the middle one-third and oldest one-third of their classmates (p < 0.001). Of the mental health problems identified in the questionnaires, the groups differed only on peer problems; the youngest one-third reported significantly more problems than the middle and oldest groups (p < 0.05). Age within a school year and gender showed significant interactions with total SDQ score, SDQ peer problems score, SDQ pro social score, and SCL-10 score. After stratifying for gender, the peer problem scores differed significantly between age groups only among boys. The SCL-10 score was significant, but only in girls and in the opposite direction to that expected, with the oldest pupils having significantly higher scores than the other two groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In adolescents from a multicultural city in Norway, relative age within a school year significantly influenced academic performance. In contrast to data from Great Britain, relative age within a school year was not an important risk factor for mental health problems in adolescents in Oslo. © 2005 Lien et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: A total of 45 stroke patients diagnosed according to the evaluative standard revised by the Fourth Academic Conference of National Cerebral Vascular Disease and lived in communities around the Second Hospital of Zhengzhou University from 2003 to 2005 were selected and randomly divided into two groups: rehabilitation group (n=25) and control group (n=20). Additionally to the same medication treatment, the rehabilitation group was treated by CBR for 3 months. Different recovered therapies were laid down according to the paralytic types of stroke patients, including motor function exercise, ADL training, psychological recovery and social adaptation training. The motor function exercise included passive motor of each joint of affected limbs, rolling exercise of affected part, balance ability training (sitting and standing balance), position transfer exercise (bed-chair transfer and sit-stand transfer), gait training (walking and stair activity) and stretching exercise of ankle of wrist. ADL training included food taking, putting on clothes, individual hygiene disposal and so on. Psychological recovery and social adaptation training included good relationabip between doctors and patients to help them strengthen confidence, release negative emotion, instruct and courage them to express feelings. The intervention was performed twice a week. Then the cognition function was measured by mini mental state examination (MMSE) and ADL were assessed by Barthel index by the same physician before and after CBR. Results: All the 45 patients were involved in the result analysis. 1 Before CBR, there was no significant difference in the scores of MMSE and Barthel index between the two groups (P > 0.05). But after CBR, the scores of the rehabilitation group were obviously higher than the control group [(56.9±9.89), (49.8±9.87), t=2.413, P < 0.05]; [(26.6±4.60), (22.9±6.70), t=2.105, P < 0.05]. 2 In the rehabilitation group, the Barthel index of the patients whose course of disease was less than 6 months was higher than that of 6-12 months and more than 12 months, which had significant differences [(67.6±8.90), (59.1±7.20), t=2.397, P < 0.05]; [(67.6±8.90), (55.7±8.20), t=2.487, P < 0.05]. Conclusion: CBR can improve cognitive function and ADL of stroke patients, and less than 6 months is the key stage for treatment of stroke, early recovery can minimally decrease the neurological function defects.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The 80-hour workweek was adopted by US residency programs on July 1, 2003. Our published data from the preceding year indicated significant impairment in psychologic well-being among surgery residents. The purpose of this study was to determine whether psychologic well-being and academic performance of surgery residents improved after inception of the 80-hour workweek. Methods. A single-blinded survey of general surgery residents (n = 130) across 4 US training programs was conducted after July 1, 2003, with the use of validated psychometric surveys (Symptom Checklist-90-R and Perceived Stress Scale) and the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination; comparison was done with preceding year and societal data. Primary outcomes were ""psychologic distress"" and ""perceived stress."" Secondary outcomes were ""somatization,"" ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" ""interpersonal sensitivity,"" ""hostility, "" ""obsessive-compulsive behavior,"" ""phobic anxiety,"" ""paranoid ideation,"" ""psychoticism."" and ""academic performance."" The impact of demographic variables was assessed. Results. Mean psychologic distress improved from the preceding year (P < .01) but remained elevated, compared with societal norms (P < .001). The proportion of residents meeting the criteria for clinical psychologic distress (≥90th percentile) decreased from 38% before, to 24% after, July 2003. Mean perceived stress remained elevated, compared with norms (P < .0001) without improvement from the preceding year. Overall academic performance was unchanged. Previously elevated secondary psychologic outcomes improved after July 2003 (P < .05), although obsessive-compulsive behavior, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and anxiety failed to normalize. Male gender and single status were independent risk factors for psychologic distress. Conclusions.

As these students are vital components of the health care delivery system, an attempt is made to identify the stressors and the various coping techniques adopted by them. Methods: First year students provided the information about their personal data, specific stressors influencing and coping techniques adopted to overcome stress by them by answering a standardized questionnaire. Further, the students gave their opinion about the effectiveness of the tutor-mentor program in the college to overcome stress. Results: 29 males and 51 females answered the questionnaire. Internal assessment examination was perceived as the most potent stressor and domestic conflicts the least. The manifestation of stress was characterized by loss of concentration, headache, mood swings, impulsive behavior, tendency to quarrel and loss of sleep. The commonly practiced coping techniques were listening to music, sleeping, social interaction, reading and isolation. Interpretation and Conclusion: First year medical students are subjected to stress by the knowledge overload and the present pattern of education. The students have attempted to overcome stress, which is individualized, and situation dependent. There is a need to train students in stress management techniques and to have regular counseling by an expert. The students felt that the present tutor-mentor program as practiced now is not fully effective in coping stress.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Data from 1,455 college women suggest that sexual harassment experiences are associated with increased psychological distress, which then relates to lower academic satisfaction, greater physical illness, and greater disordered eating. The cumulative effect is greater disengagement from the academic environment, which in turn relates to performance decline (i.e., lower grades). Regardless of how frequently the harassment occurred, academic satisfaction was lower when the harassment came from higher-status individuals (i.e., faculty, staff, or administrators). At the same time, harassment was equally detrimental to mental health, regardless of who perpetrated it.

As excessive stress hampers students' performance, stress management is required for medical students. This study was aimed to assess the effect of Mind Sound Technology (MST), an intelligence enhancing program, on psychological well-being of medical undergraduates during exam stress. Materials and Methods: Forty-two medical students were recruited and Dukes Health Profile scoring was done at baseline and during Exam Stress (ES). After pre-intervention measurements, the students were randomized into two groups: non-practitioners and MST practitioners. Post-intervention measurement was done at the end of 6 weeks when the students had examination. Results: Students showed a significant increase (P < 0.001) in negative health scores like perceived health scores, anxiety, and depression and a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in positive health scores like Self-Esteem, Mental Health Score, Social Health Score, and General Health Score during exam when compared with baseline. MST practice increased positive health scores (P < 0.001) and decreased perceived health score (P < 0.01), anxiety, depression, and anxiety-depression scores significantly (P < 0.001) when compared with ES score. Non practitioners did not show any significant change in any of the scores when compared with ES score. Six weeks of MST practice by medical students have improved the academic scores (P < 0.05) when compared with their non-practitioner counterpart. Conclusion: Thus, practice of MST has helped in coping up the stress that occurs during examination and improved academic performance in medical undergraduates.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of stress among medical students and to observe an association between the levels of stress and their academic performance, including the sources of their stress. All the medical students from year one to year five levels from the College of Medicine, King Saud University, were enrolled in the study. The study was conducted using Kessler10 psychological distress (K10) inventory, which measures the level of stress according to none, mild, moderate, and severe categories. The prevalence of stress was measured and compared with the five study variables, such as gender, academic year, academic grades, regularity to course attendance, and perceived physical problems. The response rate among the study subjects was 87% (n=892). The total prevalence of stress was 63%, and the prevalence of severe stress was 25%. The prevalence of stress was higher (p<0.5) among females (75.7%) than among males (57%) (odds ratio=2.3, χ2=27.2, p<0.0001). The stress significantly decreased as the year of study increased, except for the final year. The study variables, including being female (p<0.0001), year of study (p<0.001), and presence of perceived physical problems (p<0.0001), were found as independent significant risk factors for the outcome variables of stress. Students' grade point average (academic score) or regularity to attend classes was not significantly associated with the stress level. The prevalence of stress was higher during the initial three years of study and among the female students. Physical problems are associated with high stress levels. Preventive mental health services, therefore, could be made an integral part of routine clinical services for medical students, especially in the initial academic years, to prevent such occurrence. © International Centre For Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

In the present study, heart rate recovery from a mental arithmetic task was examined after participants received bogus performance-related feedback that could be consistent or inconsistent with their specific self-concept about their mental arithmetic skills. That way, the participants' beliefs about their own performance in the task were experimentally manipulated. Recovery of heart rate was examined in two time windows: (1) shortly after the participants had completed the task and had received positive or negative performance feedback and (2) 10. min after the task. In order to evaluate the dynamic of changes in more detail, speed of recovery (linear slope of the continuous beat-to-beat data) was analysed in addition to the degree of recovery (average heart rate decline during the five-minute observation periods). The results indicate that negative performance-related feedback may prolong psychophysiological responses to stressful conditions, in particular when the feedback is inconsistent with the domain-specific self-concept. In conjunction with other evidence these results support the assumption that positive emotional states in the context of stressful events may contribute to poor post-stress recovery. Overall, the findings are supportive of the ""perseverative cognition hypothesis"" according to which psychophysiological recovery may be delayed through continued cognitive representation of a negative experience. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Children from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds perform below children from higher SES backgrounds on tests of intelligence and academic achievement, and recent findings indicate that low SES (LSES) children are impaired on behavioral measures of prefrontal function. However, the influence of socioeconomic disparity on direct measures of neural activity is unknown. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence indicating that prefrontal function is altered in LSES children. We found that prefrontal-dependent electrophysiological measures of attention were reduced in LSES compared to high SES (HSES) children in a pattern similar to that observed in patients with lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) damage. These findings provide neurophysiological evidence that social inequalities are associated with alterations in PFC function in LSES children. There are a number of factors associated with LSES rearing conditions that may have contributed to these results such as greater levels of stress and lack of access to cognitively stimulating materials and experiences.

Stress that leads to depression may be mediated if people believe that they have the wherewithal to manage it. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which the relationship between adverse stress and depression is mediated by university students' perceived ability to manage their stress. Method: Students were sampled randomly at a Canadian university in 2006 (n = 2,147) and 2008 (n = 2,292). Data about students' stress (1 item), depression (4 items), stress management self-efficacy (4 items), and their demographics were obtained via the online National College Health Assessment survey and analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and latent variable mediation modeling. Results: Greater stress management self-efficacy was associated with lower depression scores for students whose stress impeded their academic performance, irrespective oftheir gender and age (total R 2 depression = 41%). The relationship between stress and depression was mediated partially by stress management self-efficacy (37% to 55% mediation, depending on the severity of stress). Conclusions: Identifying students with limited stress management self-efficacy and providing them with appropriate supportive services may help them to manage stress and prevent depression.

Results: Although there was a strong correlation between scores on the YSR and CBCL corresponding scales, parent/child discrepancies were more likely to occur when the later: had good academic performance, were dissatisfied from their self-image or their life. Parental factors that influence discrepancies in parent/child scale scores were: low paternal education for both genders, father being the informant for boys, and maternal stress and lack of awareness of leisure activities for girls.

Some studies show that these professionals have a higher prevalence of psychiatric symptoms than the general population. This phenomenon is a consequence of the particular conditions of this professional activity, and, in the case of students, of high academic demands that lead to stressful situations that interfere with their academic performance and the development of clinical skills, which may have repercussions on their relationship with their patients. The predominant symptoms are anxiety, depression and stress, as well as substance use; there has also been an increase in the number of students with suicide attempts. Most of these problems occur during the first two years of the degree course as well as the internship year. Depression is masked by anger, by virtue of the fact that it is an internalized form of anger. It has also been documented that there is a significant link between certain personality traits and the presence or absence of mental symptoms, regardless of the situations to which people are exposed. The feature with the highest association with the presence of symptomatology is neuroticism, while the personality traits that are most conducive to the achievement of academic success and better adaptation and, therefore, a lower number of symptoms are empathy and kindness. The purpose of this study was to establish a diagnosis of the mental health and personality traits of medical students in the high performance groups and compare them with those of the groups of students that performed poorly during the first two years of the degree course. This transversal, exploratory study involved the participation of 370 students from the UNAM Medical School: 220 belonged to the high performance groups, called educational quality nuclei (NUCE), while 150 were repeat students. The variables considered were: age, sex, type of group (NUCE or repeat), academic year (first or second year of the degree), place of origin and type of high school from which they had graduated (public or private). Two instruments were used to measure personality traits and psychiatric symptomatology: the Big Five Personality Traits and the Symptom Check List-90. The results of the study show that in both groups (repeat students and NUCE) over 85% were from the Federal District. Repeat students were mainly women (85.3%) and students from public schools (93.6%). As for the high performance group (NUCE), 83.1% were from private schools and just 16.9% from public schools. Repeat students showed personality traits that included neuroticism and very little openness compared with the high performance groups, which displayed traits of greater openness and less neuroticism, with p<0.01. In general, students from NUCE groups showed traits of greater extraversion, empathy and diligence compared with repeaters. Psychiatric symptomatology was more severe among the repeat group than the NUCE group (p<0.05). The psychiatric symptomatology displayed by both groups included: obsession-compulsion, depression and anxiety. In the comparisons, the two groups showed significant differences in total symptomatology. There were also differences in the following symptomatology, by order of importance: phobia, interpersonal sensitivity, somatization, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and psychoticism (p<0.05). Differences were found between academic years, with second-year students showing greater symptomatology; women displayed the greatest symptomatology. No differences were found for the interaction between sex and academic year. The analysis of structural models was used to determine the relationship between the variables being studied, with significant correlation coefficients with p<.05 being found between personality and sex, personality and type of high school, as well as type of group and suicidal ideation, academic year and psychiatric symptomatology, personality and suicidal ideation and personality and psychiatric symptomatology. The results of the study coincided with those in the literature, although there were some differences between the two groups of students. Repeat students displayed greater levels of psychiatric symptomatology compared with students in the high performance groups. This suggests that students who perform less well in their degree courses also report higher mean responses in psychiatric symptomatology, mainly on scales of somatization, anxiety, phobia and interpersonal sensitivity. As for type of personality, students in the high performance group reported higher average scores on the scales of extraversion, empathy and openness, with the exception of the neuroticism scale. This suggests that personality features may be predictors of better academic performance as well as greater intellectual skill. This finding is reinforced by the repeater group's results, since they report higher scores in the personality trait of neuroticism. The diligence scale was the same for both groups. The study corroborated the fact that second-year students display the greatest symptomatology, with women reporting higher averages in psychiatric symptomatology scores (mean=7.3). Sex is associated with greater empathy and solidarity, with women achieving higher scores in both personality traits. Although the neuroticism trait is also associated with the female sex and suicidal ideation, scores for this trait were higher for men. This trait can be considered a predictor for both suicidal ideation and the presence of a higher number of psychiatric symptoms. Lastly, the symptomatology in which these students obtained the highest scores is related to the obsessive-compulsive disorder, a situation which we consider may be due to the type of screening test used. It is a fact that studying medicine involves continuously stressful conditions. For these students, however, seeking help to cope with the presence of psychiatric symptomatology is extremely complicated since they regard it as a form of weakness. This raises the need to develop large-scale programs to orient students in order to enable them to identify symptoms at an early stage, which in turn will permit timely treatment.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Adverse perinatal factors, poor academic performance, fights or quarrels with peers, comorbidity, and a higher frequency of physical punishment and accidents during childhood were found to be associated with ADHD-like symptoms at 7 years. Factors identified to be related with these symptoms at 18 years included male gender, maternal stress, smoking during pregnancy, physical punishment, and psychological problems in childhood.

Methods.A population-based online survey regarding premenstrual symptoms was conducted in 1000 Korean women aged 1549 years. Symptoms were classified according to their intensity, persistence each cycle, and impairment of ADL. Women's knowledge of PMSs and physician consultations were assessed. Results.The approximate prevalence of PMS/premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) by the WHO's International Classification of Disease (ICD-10), American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV[4th edition]) criteria was 98.6, 32.1, and 2.8%, respectively. Among 23 documented symptoms, the most predominant symptoms were joint-muscle-back pain, abdominal pain, and irritability. Physical symptoms were more prevalent than mental symptoms. There was a high correlation between the duration and severity of symptoms. The impact of PMS on ADL and the proportion of women with impaired ADL were significantly associated with the severity of PMS. The proportion of women consulting physicians increased with severity of PMS from 2%, 2.3%, for ICD-10, ACOG PMS to 10.7% for DSM-IV PMDD, respectively. Most of the women (91.5%) had no knowledge regarding terminology pertaining to PMS and PMDD.

The aim of this study is to assess the effect of diagnosis of cancer on the parents, to study the coping response adopted by the child and the family and to evolve counseling strategies. Methods. Prospective questionnaire based. Thirty four parents of children suffering from cancer were included, of which 15 belonged to joint families and 19 to nuclear families. Results. The family support played an important role in giving emotional sustenance, besides shared care of the child, the sibling and the household. Emotional and psychological impact was maximum on the mothers. Siblings of the cancer child were also affected both by way of behaviour problems and school performance. Behaviour problems in the cancer child included temper tantrums, as also verbal and physical abuse of mothers. Group therapy was useful for sharing emotional trauma and exchanging day to day problems of childcare. Positive outlook helped in better care of the cancer child. Conclusion. The family structure was the foundation for emotional and psychological security. Psychological support by professional tumour support group would enhance this. © 2007 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study extends the 2006 National Sleep Foundation examination of sleep in early adolescence by examining sleep in older adolescents. Method: One thousand one hundred twenty-five students aged 17 to 24 years from an urban Midwestern university completed a cross-sectional online survey about sleep habits that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Scale, the Profile of Mood States, the Subjective Units of Distress Scale, and questions about academic performance, physical health, and psychoactive drug use. Results: Students reported disturbed sleep; over 60% were categorized as poor-quality sleepers by the PSQI, bedtimes and risetimes were delayed during weekends, and students reported frequently taking prescription, over the counter, and recreational psychoactive drugs to alter sleep/wakefulness. Students classified as poor-quality sleepers reported significantly more problems with physical and psychological health than did good-quality sleepers. Students overwhelmingly stated that emotional and academic stress negatively impacted sleep. Multiple regression analyses revealed that tension and stress accounted for 24% of the variance in the PSQI score, whereas exercise, alcohol and caffeine consumption, and consistency of sleep schedule were not significant predictors of sleep quality. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that insufficient sleep and irregular sleep-wake patterns, which have been extensively documented in younger adolescents, are also present at alarming levels in the college student population. Given the close relationships between sleep quality and physical and mental health, intervention programs for sleep disturbance in this population should be considered. © 2010 Society for Adolescent Medicine.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

METHODS: We carried out an electronic survey of all medical undergraduate students at the University of Aberdeen during May-June 2004. The questionnaire contained items about demographics, debt, income and stress. Students were also asked for consent to access their examination results, which were correlated with their answers. Statistical analyses of the relationships between debt, performance and stress were performed. RESULTS: The median total outstanding debt was £7300 (interquartile range 2000-14 762.50). Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and postgraduate students had higher debts. There was no direct correlation between debt, class ranking or General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score; however, a subgroup of 125 students (37.7%), who said that worrying about money affected their studies, did have higher debt and were ranked lower in their classes. Some of these students were also cases on the GHQ-12. Overall, however, cases on the GHQ had lower levels of debt and lower class ranking, suggesting that financial worries are only 1 cause of mental health difficulties. DISCUSSION: Students' perceptions of their own levels of debt rather than level of debt per se relates to performance. Students who worry about money have higher debts and perform less well than their peers in degree examinations. Some students in this subgroup were also identified by the GHQ and may have mental health problems. The relationships between debt, mental health and performance in undergraduate medical students are complex but need to be appreciated by medical education policy makers. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Design/methodology/approach: The American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA), a 58-item anonymous survey, was distributed to all graduate health science students during a five-week period in the spring semester. Findings: Students (n=1,355) were most likely to report a negative perceived academic impact related to psychosocial concerns such as stress, depression/anxiety, and relationship problems. The students' most pressing felt concerns were upper respiratory infections, stress, concerns about troubled loved ones and sleep difficulties. Clinical graduate students (n=712) were significantly more likely to report negative academic impacts related to upper respiratory infections (p=0.001), concern about a troubled friend or family member (p=0.001), sleep difficulties (p=0.005), relationship difficulties (p=0.030), and internet use/computer games (p=0.015) than non-clinical graduate students. However, the magnitude of those differences was small. Practical implications: This paper adds to one's knowledge of student health concerns, which may help to address health-related barriers to learning. Originality/value: This paper presents findings that further explicate the reciprocal relationship between student health and learning by suggesting methodology to identify priority health issues among a graduate student population. Findings from this study of over 20 different health concerns indicate that the priority health concerns of graduate health science students are primarily psychological and psychosocial health issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The objective of this study is to describe caregivers' characteristics and evaluate their burden and quality of life. Methods: We studied caregivers of elderly patients (≥65 years) on hemodialysis (HD) therapy (n = 84), on peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy (n = 40), and a group of caregivers (n = 77) of nonelderly HD patients. Their quality of life was evaluated by using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire, Caregiver Burden scale, and Cognitive Index of Depression. Results: Most caregivers of the elderly were women (78%) aged 55 ± 15 years and sons or daughters (41%) or wives or husbands (50%) of patients. Caregivers' Emotional Aspect, Vitality, and Mental Health were the most affected dimensions. The Mental Component Summary mean score, adjusted for patient race, educational level, primary diagnosis, hematocrit, comorbidities, and physical functional status, was worse for caregivers of PD than HD elderly patients (36.3 ± 1.9 versus 44.8 ± 1.5; P < 0.01). The most affected Caregiver Burden scale dimensions were General Strain and Environment. Thirty-two percent of caregivers showed signs of depression. Conclusion: Caregivers of elderly dialysis patients, especially of those on PD therapy, experience a significant burden and adverse effects on their quality of life.

This paper examines performance at the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), examined at age 16, with reference to psychological distress and depressive symptoms as measured at age 13-14. Methods: The data come from a school based prospective epidemiological study of a representative multiethnic sample of adolescents attending East London secondary schools in Tower Hamlets, Hackney, and Newham. Logistic regression analysis was carried out using STATA to test for differences in the impact of different types of psychological distress on achievement. Results: The overall score for psychological distress, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), was negatively associated with achievement at GCSE for both boys (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.24-0.69) and girls (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.87). There was evidence for an association between achievement and depressive symptoms, as measured by the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), for boys only (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.79). There was weak evidence for an interaction between ethnicity and SMFQ for girls. Results from a subset of analyses adjusting for prior achievement suggested that the association between psychological distress at age 13-14 and GCSE achievement could not be explained simply by achievement at age 13-14. Conclusions: The results suggest that psychological distress is associated with educational achievement. Low achievement at school can have a substantial effect on opportunities in adult life. This implies a greater need for support within the school for children with psychological difficulties in order to achieve the best possible outcomes in the long term. © Steinkopff Verlag Darmstadt 2008.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Male and female students perceive and react to stressors differently due to their differences in appraising stressful situations.Aims: The aims of this study were to examine differences in the perception of stressors and reactions to stressors between male and female Jordanian university students, and to identify the best predictors of stressors among them.Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional design was employed. The Student-Life Stress Inventory was used to measure stressors and reactions to stressors of 465 male and 485 female Jordanian university students recruited through stratified random sampling.Results: There were statistical differences between male and female students regarding their perception and reactions to stressors. Female students reported a higher perception of stressors in frustrations, conflict, pressures and changes, as well as emotional reactions to stressors. Male students reported higher behavioural and cognitive reactions to stressors than female students. Participation in stress workshops, perception of general health, and perception of stress level in general were found to predict stressors among male students, while mother's educational level, perception of general health, and perception of stress level in general were found to predict stressors among female students.Conclusions: This study showed that gender differences in perception of stressors and reactions to stressors are similar to previous studies conducted all over the world. Interventions can be developed to help students better cope with stress.

Method: The epidemiological survey of children's mental health included a representative sample of 420 school children. Local teachers were trained to administer a translation of the UCLA-PTSD Index Form. The instrument and the epidemiological findings were validated by assessment through clinical expert interview, school grades, and neuropsychological testing in a subsample (N = 67). Results: Ninety-two percent of the children surveyed had experienced severely traumatizing events such as combat, bombing, shelling, or witnessing the death of a loved one. Twenty-five percent met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. Traumatized children reported lasting interference of experiences with their daily life, which was corroborated by memory testing, scores in school performance and ratings of social withdrawal. Depressive symptoms and poor physical health were frequent in these children. The majority of trained teachers achieved valid results in the structured interviews. Conclusion: Performance and functioning in children are related to the total load of traumatic events experienced. An important component of psychosocial programs in post-conflict areas should include increasing community-based awareness of the consequences of traumatic stress, both as a preventative measure and as a way of decreasing stigmatization of affected individuals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A critical need is to identify sources and processes related to sleep disruptions and their sequelae. We examined a model linking parental marital conflict and children's emotional insecurity, sleep disruptions, and their adjustment and academic problems. Method: One hundred and sixty-six elementary school children reported on marital conflict and their emotional insecurity, the quantity and quality of children's sleep were examined through actigraphy, and parents and teachers reported on child functioning. Results: In the context of exposure to normative levels of marital conflict, children's emotional insecurity regarding their parents'marital relationship is an intervening variable in the marital conflict-sleep disruptions link. In turn, disruptions in the quality and duration of children's sleep have a negative effect on children's behavioral, emotional, and academic performance. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of marital conflict and children's emotional insecurity as variables that can affect a fundamental aspect of biological regulation, sleep, which consequently influences children's adjustment and academic performance. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

It has been speculated that these problems impair students' quality of life (QoL). The authors aimed to assess the health-related QoL (HRQL) of medical students throughout their 6 years of training at a school with a traditional curriculum. Methods Of a total of 490 students attending our institution's medical school, 38 were surveyed in February 2006 (incoming Year 1 group, surveyed when students were in the second week of Year 1 classes) and 352 were surveyed in February 2007 (students in Years 1-6). Students self-reported their HRQL and depressive symptoms using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Comparisons were performed according to year in training, presence of depressive symptoms, gender, living arrangements and correlations with family income. Results The students' ages ranged from 18 to 31 years (median 22.3 years). Students in Years 2, 3, 4 and 6 had lower scores for mental and physical dimensions of HRQL compared with the incoming Year 1 group (P < 0.01), with the largest difference observed for Year 3 students. Students with depressive symptoms had lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 (P < 0.01). Female students had lower HRQL scores than males (P < 0.01). No differences were observed for students living with versus without family and no correlation with family income was found. Conclusions Major impairments in HRQL were observed among Year 3 students, students with depressive symptoms and women. Medical schools should institute efforts to ensure that students' HRQL and emotional support are maintained, particularly during critical phases of medical training. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2010.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Method: Around one year after a super-cyclone, proportion of adolescents exhibiting post-traumatic psychiatric symptoms, prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, comorbidity and impairment of performance in school were studied in Orissa, India. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for children and adolescents was used for evaluation and diagnosis. The criteria for diagnoses were based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - IV. Results: Post-disaster psychiatric presentation in adolescents was a conglomeration of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. The prevalences of PTSD, major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder were 26.9%, 17.6% and 12.0% respectively. Proportion of adolescents with any diagnosis was 37.9%. Comorbidity was found in 39.0% of adolescents with a psychiatric diagnosis. Adolescents from middle socioeconomic status were more affected. There were gender differences in the presentation of the symptoms rather than on the prevalence of diagnoses. Prolonged periods of helplessness and lack of adequate post-disaster psychological support were perceived as probable influencing factors, as well as the severity of the disaster.

Poor college adjustment correlates with poor academic performance, low graduation rates, and poor success later in life. Limited data are available on the effects of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on college adjustment. We hypothesize that disease activity negatively impacts on QOL, and adversely affects college adjustment. Methods: Undergraduate students (6 Crohn's disease [CD], 12 ulcerative colitis [UC], 19 healthy controls) completed a standardized college adjustment survey (SACQ) and QOL instrument (SF-12). Where appropriate, disease specific activity and QOL indices were obtained (HBI, SCCAI, SIBDQ). Results: There was an inverse correlation between disease activity and college adjustment in CD and UC (R = -0.6554, p 0.0032). IBD students had lower physical QOL (SF-12) than controls (p = 0.0009). Emotional domain of college adjustment correlated best with SIBDQ (R = 0.8228, p < 0.0001), and correlated better in CD (R = 0.8619) than UC (R = 0.7946). Mental QOL (SF-12) was worse in CD than UC (p = 0.0211), but neither differed from controls (p = 0.4, p = 0.6). Conclusions: Students with active Crohn's and colitis adjust less well to college life. Physical and emotional factors likely contribute. More aggressive medical therapy and better emotional support before and during college may result in happier and healthier college students, leading to higher graduation rates and future success. Interventions resulting in better disease control and support systems may improve college performance and provide long-term benefits to young adults with IBD.

The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic review of the evidence for the effectiveness of short activity bouts incorporated into organizational routine as part of the regular ""conduct of business."" Evidence acquisition: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases were searched in August 2009 (updated search in February and July 2010) to identify relevant, peer-reviewed journal articles and abstracts on school-, worksite-, and faith-based interventions of short, structurally integrated physical activity breaks. Evidence synthesis: The majority of interventions implemented daily physical activity bouts of 1015 minutes in length. Schools were the most common settings among the 40 published articles included in this review. The rigor of the studies varied by setting, with more than 75% of worksite versus 25% of school studies utilizing RCT designs. Studies focused on a broad range of outcomes, including academic/work performance indicators, mental health outcomes, and clinical disease risk indicators, in addition to physical activity level. Physical activity was the most commonly assessed outcome in school-based studies, with more than half of studies assessing and observing improvements in physical activity outcomes following the intervention. About a quarter of worksite-based studies assessed physical activity, and the majority found a positive effect of the intervention on physical activity levels. About half of studies also observed improvements in other relevant outcomes such as academic and work performance indicators (e.g., academic achievement, cognitive performance, work productivity); psychosocial factors (e.g., stress, mood); and clinical disease risk indicators (e.g., blood pressure, BMI). The average study duration was more than 1 year, and several reported outcomes at 3-6 years. Conclusions: Interventions integrating physical activity into organizational routine during everyday life have demonstrated modest but consistent benefits, particularly for physical activity, and these are promising avenues of investigation. The proportionately longer-term outcomes available in these studies compared with individual-level studies suggest that physical activity promotion strategies at the organizational level may be more sustainable. © 2011 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Furthermore, increasing stress may result in declining student performance. The aim of the present study was to assess perceived sources of stress amongst dental undergraduate students at a private dental institution in India.Materials and methods: A modified dental environment stress (DES) questionnaire which consisted of 38 questions was used to assess the levels of stress. Results: The first major stressor for all the students was examination and grades with a mean score of 2.86 (SD 1.06) followed by full working day, receiving criticism from supervisors about academic or clinical work, amount of cheating in dental faculty, rules and regulations of the faculty and fear of unemployment after graduation. Amongst the six highest stressors in each year, at least three were dental faculty related. There was a significant difference in stress perception between genders with a predilection for males. Twelve of the 38 questionnaire items had significant differences across the year groups including clinical DES items. Conclusion: The primary sources of stress as perceived by nearly 275 students at one private dental school in India were examinations and grades followed by full working day and receiving criticism from supervisors about academic or clinical work. It appears there is a need for the establishment of student advisors and counsellors combined with a faculty advising system in addition to student-oriented programmes. © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

The students, especially girls, were highly stressed. No class differences were found. Performance-related stressors were predominately indicated by students in academic programmes and girls (regardless of class). Looks-related stress was more common among girls than boys, whilst economic and relational stressors were mostly indicated by vocational programme students, particularly girls. There was a complex gender and class patterning of stress due to demands and lack of money. The interplay of gender and class should be acknowledged in identifying determinants of stress in young people.

Introduction. Psychological wellbeing facilitates the learning performance while emotional problems such as anxiety/depression limit it and may impact on future professional practice. Objectives. To assess the prevalence of anxiety/depression in nursing students in Rome, at the beginning of the annual course. Methods. An observational study was conducted administering the 12 items General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to 601 students at the beginning of the annual course. Students were labeled at risk for anxiety and depression with GHQ-12 scores >5. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated to anxiety and depression. Results. Thirthy-four per cent (39% of the females) of the students were at risk for anxiety/depression. The risk was higher for female students (OR=2.9; 95%CI 1.6-5.2; p<0.001), in those unsatisfied with the academic results (OR 2.3; 95%CI 1.4-3.9; p=0.002) and with their general health status (OR=0.4; 95%CI 0.3-0.7; p≤0.001).

A literature review revealed five themes that aligned with analysis of interview data from a previous study (Laws and Fiedler, 2010). The key themes were i) staff were often disturbed by unplanned intrusions of students who exhibited behavioural problems or sought emotional support, ii) the management of emotions in face-to-face encounters was stressful, iii) staff felt under-equipped for dealing with Mental Health (MH) issues, iv) standards and control needed updating and v) counselling and disability services did not meet academics' need to know about 'at risk' students. Objective: Having identified the incidence of mental health issues among Australian University students, this study aims to locate literature that describes how well current university policies/protocols are supported by Evidence Based Practice in the management of MH problems in the student population. Design/setting/participants: Findings from a content analysis of the literature were triangulated with verbatim comments recorded during a previous study that utilised semi structured interviews with 34 academics at the School of Nursing and Midwifery and the School of Commerce at the University of South Australia (Laws and Fiedler, 2010). Results: Lack of clarity on role boundaries around promotion of students' well-being was not clearly defined. The Higher Education (HE) institutions' slowness in responding to mental health needs of students combined with the increasing expectations of academics' performance monitoring has lead staff to avoid deep investment in their students' well-being. The literature indicates that students are in need of psychological support, but pastoral care remains ill-defined despite enduring expectations held by university administrators. Teacher motivation is diminished by time spent with students in need of emotional support which is not acknowledged in workloads. Staff stress is increased by 'emotion work' requiring a greater integration of resources that guide them toward more appropriate and timely student support. Conclusion: Staff require ongoing professional development on the nature of MH problems among students. There is a need for specific orientation programs that better define pastoral care and identify support services for staff and students. Universities need to focus on what is needed to create a well-being environment. Workload allocations must include 'emotion work', and mental health professionals must be employed to improve intervention and support not only for students but also for University staff. With better defined pastoral care roles, academics can more effectively balance their intrinsic and extrinsic motivations toward both personal and corporate objectives. Further research into the efficacy of university resourcing of programs and services is needed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

High levels of stress are believed to affect students' health as well as their academic performance. Aims: The aims of this study were to identify stressors and reactions to stressors among university students, and to examine the correlations between student stressors and study variables. Methods: A correlational descriptive design was used. Student-life Stress Inventory (SSI) was used to measure the stressors and reactions to stressors. Stratified random sampling was employed to recruit participants. The final sample consisted of 877 participants (students). Results: Results indicated that the highest group of stressors experienced by students were 'self-imposed' stressors followed by 'pressures'. Cognitive responses were found to be the highest responses to stressors experienced by students. Negative correlations were found with student's perception of health, and father's and mother's level of education. Conclusions: This study revealed that stressors among university students come from 'self-imposed' stressors and 'pressures'.

Results: Four review articles reported evidence concerning depression, four for anxiety, three for self-esteem and seven for cognitive functioning. Nine primary studies assessed associations between sedentary behaviour and mental health. Physical activity has potentially benefi cial effects for reduced depression, but the evidence base is limited. Intervention designs are low in quality, and many reviews include cross-sectional studies. Physical activity interventions have been shown to have a small benefi cial effect for reduced anxiety, but the evidence base is limited. Physical activity can lead to improvements in self-esteem, at least in the short term. However, there is a paucity of good quality research. Reviews on physical activity and cognitive functioning have provided evidence that routine physical activity can be associated with improved cognitive performance and academic achievement, but these associations are usually small and inconsistent. Primary studies showed consistent negative associations between mental health and sedentary behaviour.

Three hundred and twenty one students from a technological university in Caracas, Venezuela, responded instruments on academic stress, social support and mental health during the most academically stressful period. The results indicate that favorable conditions of mental health were associated to more social support and less academic stress. In women, higher stress levels were associated to a lesser amount of social support from friends whereas in men stress was related to less social support coming from close people and general social support. Both displayed better performance when perceived higher levels of academic stress and the social support of the near people was moderate.

The College of Medicine follows a problem-based curriculum in which science is integrated with professional skills and a community-health programme, comprising of maternal and child health, family studies, and population-health research. The family-studies programme requires all third-year students to complete a wide series of activities under family-physician supervision. Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the performance of the programme with specific regard to students' family-health advocacy roles. Method: A trained community-health nurse administered a semistructured questionnaire based on family empowerment to 30 families. Themes included health-knowledge gains, positive changes in lifestyle and communication practices, and accessing community resources. Results: All families reported a gain in relevant health knowledge, and a number of families reported positive changes in lifestyle. Conclusions: Students proved to be valuable advocates for families in this programme. Their principal role lay in the uncovering of psychosocial distress, but they were able also to offer practical help in lifestyle behaviour changes, communication, and community-resource use.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Identification of etiological factors for AD and active implementation of interventions targeting those modifiable factors that may prevent or postpone clinical onset of the dementing disorder will provide an opportunity to cope with this challenge. Multidisciplinary research involving epidemiology, neuropathology, and neuroimaging has provided moderately strong evidence supporting the role of vascular factors and related disorders (e.g., midlife high blood pressure and obesity, diabetes, cerebral microvascular lesions, and smoking) as risk factors and the possible role of psychosocial factors (e.g., high educational achievements, mentally-stimulating activity, social engagement, and physical exercise) as protective factors in the development and clinical manifestation of the dementia syndrome, including AD. The implementation of long-term, multidomain interventions designed for the modification of multiple vascular risk factors and the maintenance of socially-integrated lifestyles and mentally-stimulating activities is expected to postpone the clinical onset of AD and dementia, and thus, substantially reduce the burden of the disease at both the individual and societal levels. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Studies of the health status of homeless children allow a window into the health status of medically underserved children whose needs may not be readily documented because of their lack of access to the health care system. Although prevalence rates of most of the health conditions discussed in this article exceeded national norms, they were generally consistent with rates characteristic of health disparities based on race-ethnicity and income. It must be emphasized that in most instances, children were seen for their first pediatric visit within weeks of entering the homeless shelter system. The health conditions identified were often present before the child and family became homeless. The high prevalence of asthma among homeless children should therefore be a matter of concern to health providers and payors, because the authors' data strongly suggest that this is not confined to children in homeless shelters as a special population. Similarly, childhood obesity predates homelessness (or at least the episode of homelessness during which health care was provided) and as such the authors' data may indicate the extent of this problem more generally among medically underserved children in the communities of origin. These conditions seem to be exacerbated by the specific conditions associated with homeless shelter life. Asthma care, assuming it was previously available, is disrupted when housing is lost, and shelter conditions may have multiple asthma triggers. Nutrition often suffers as a result of inadequate access to nutritious food and cooking facilities in shelters, as indicated by the high rate of iron-deficiency anemia among very young children. It is clear that homeless children in shelters require enhanced access to primary and specialist care. Shelter placement necessarily disrupts prior health care relationships (if any), while simultaneously placing additional stress on the child's physical and emotional well being. A medical home model is strongly recommended to allow for continuous, culturally competent care. Developmental and mental health problems are also more prevalent among homeless children. These conditions may jeopardize life successes. The overcrowding associated with homeless shelters and the housing conditions that frequently precede episodes of homelessness are associated with the higher prevalence of otitis media found among young children. This in turn is associated with developmental delay. Also contributing to the developmental risk associated with homelessness is exposure to DV, which is also frequently an antecedent of homelessness. Developmental surveillance for young homeless children, monitoring of school attendance and academic performance, and assessment of mental status for homeless adolescents are recommended to facilitate early identification of problems and delivery of necessary interventions. For young children, providers of health care to the homeless should be well networked into the Early Intervention and Preschool Special Education programs in their locality. Given the multiplicity of needs for homeless families, which of course includes help finding affordable housing, health care providers serving this population should also develop linkages with community agencies, including those that can help parents develop the skills necessary for economic self-sufficiency and long-term ability to sustain independent housing. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Background: While the emotional impact of preparing to be a health professional can be reduced by helping students to adapt, the positive effect of curriculum innovation and redesign is rarely evaluated. Design, sample and methods: Student nurse well-being and performance was compared at weeks 24/25 and 40/50 following course entry between comparable independent cohorts of students undertaking a traditional programme (N = 406, 83% return rate) with those on an innovative, student-centred, problem-based educational programme (N = 447, 79% return rate). The setting was a School of Nursing and Midwifery in the North-East of Scotland. Measures included stress and mental health outcomes and measures of performance including academic marks and sickness absence. Results: At week 25 into the course students on the innovative course had fewer academic, clinical and personal worries than students in the previous more traditional programme and were more likely to report using adaptive direct, problem-solving coping at week 50. While students on the innovative course reported less distress in their first year of the course, they scored less well on comparable essay assignments and had reliably greater sickness absence totals than those educated by traditional methods. Conclusion: In this setting, curriculum innovation was associated with positive changes in student well-being but not on performance. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This review of the medical and business literature found that this potential is still largely untapped, with few existing disease management programs for depression and only one with a published, peer-reviewed evaluation. However, there is a large evidence base for potential components of a disease management program from the academic literature on quality improvement for depression treatment. The business literature documents several employer responses to depressive disorders aside from traditional disease management including stress reduction and wellness programs, depression education programs, Employee Assistance Programs, and disability claim management. This review finds evidence of substantial costs of this illness in the workplace, particularly the indirect costs of reduced productivity, and potential strategies for employers to reduce these costs. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Sources: Review of the literature using MEDLINE and PsycInfo (1980-2007) databases, selecting the most representative articles on the subject. Special attention was paid to contributions by internationally renowned investigators on the subject. Summary of the findings: Divorce may be responsible for a decline of physical and psychological health in children. The developmental maladjustment of children is not triggered by divorce itself, but rather by other risk factors associated with it, such as interparental conflict, parental psychopathology, decline in socio-economic level, inconsistency in parenting styles, a parallel and conflicting co-parenting relationship between parents and low levels of social support. Such risk factors trigger maladjusted developmental pathways, marked by psychopathological symptoms, poor academic performance, worst levels of physical health, risk behavior, exacerbated psychophysiological responses to stress and weakening of the immune system. Conclusions: Clear links were observed between experiencing parental divorce and facing problems of physical and psychological maladjustment in children. Divorce is a stressor that should be considered by health professionals as potentially responsible for maladjusted neuropsychobiological responses and for decline in children's physical health.

Mood and motivation measures were administered pre and post intervention. Standardized examinations were taken 8-10 weeks later. As hypothesized, results indicated that an increase in the functionality of pupils' cognitions served as the mechanism by which mental health improved in the SMI group. In contrast, the control group demonstrated no such improvements. Also, as predicted, an increase in motivation accounted for the SMI group's significantly better performance on the standardized, academic assessments that comprise the United Kingdom's General Certificate of Secondary Education. Indeed, the magnitude of this enhanced performance was, on average, one-letter grade. Discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The present paper aims to investigate whether the daily intake of phospholipid concentrate (PL) rich in phosphatidylserine (PS) and sphingomyelin (SM) has similar beneficial effects on working memory, allostastic load and the acute stress response. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 46 healthy men (average 41.5 years) received either placebo or 13.5 g per day PL over a three-week period. On the 21st day of PL intake, subjects' working memory performance and their psychological and endocrine responses to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) were tested. Findings: Compared to placebo-exposed individuals, there was a tendency for shorter reaction times in the working memory task, suggesting better performance in PL-treated subjects. The two treatment groups did not significantly differ in their endocrine stress response. However, PL-treated subjects with a higher stress load showed a blunted psychological stress response. Practical implications: Results of the present study show beneficial effects of PL intake on cognitive performance. Under acute stress, benefits of PL may only be visible in chronically stressed subjects. Originality/value: This paper provides new information for practitioners, academics and food supplement industries interested in possible beneficial effects of a milk phospholipid product on memory and mental stress. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The aim of the present work was to study the psychosocial characteristics of diabetic students and to determine predictors of diabetes control. A cross-sectional study of 150 diabetic students who attended the diabetic school health insurance clinic of Sporting Student's Hospital in Alexandria governorate within a period of one month was conducted. A pre-designed interviewing questionnaire was used to collect--from the child and/or his/her parents--personal data, data about the child social relationships and school and disease characteristics. School adjustment index and stress symptom index were used to assess the school performance and the stress symptoms respectively. The result revealed that 34% of the diabetic students were maladjusted to school and 31.3% were symptomatic based on the stress index. Generally speaking, diabetic children reported good relationship to peers (65.3%), parents (57.3%) and siblings (51.3%), most of them have good friendship (82%) and those involved in one or more kind of hobby were about three fourth of all. Both age (P<0.05), sex (P<0.05), social class (P<0.05), disease duration (P<0.05) and stress symptoms (P<0.05) were all significantly associated with the disease control. However after adjustment for other variables, students of low social class families (OR=5.1, p<0.01) and those of longer disease duration (6-10 years) (OR=7.9, p<0.05) were significant predictors of diabetes control. In conclusion diabetes per se might have no significant association with academic performance or social relationship. Students with large diabetic duration-especially those of low social class families--are at increased risk of suboptimal glycaemic control and should be targeted for interventional strategies.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

METHOD: Medline and PubMed were searched to identify peer-reviewed English-language studies published between January 1980 and May 2005 reporting on depression, anxiety, and burnout among U.S. and Canadian medical students. Searches used combinations of the Medical Subject Heading terms medical student and depression, depressive disorder major, depressive disorder, professional burnout, mental health, depersonalization, distress, anxiety, or emotional exhaustion. Reference lists of retrieved articles were inspected to identify relevant additional articles. Demographic information, instruments used, prevalence data on student distress, and statistically significant associations were abstracted. RESULTS: The search identified 40 articles on medical student psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, burnout, and related mental health problems) that met the authors' criteria. No studies of burnout among medical students were identified. The studies suggest a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students, with levels of overall psychological distress consistently higher than in the general population and age-matched peers by the later years of training. Overall, the studies suggest psychological distress may be higher among female students. Limited data were available regarding the causes of student distress and its impact on academic performance, dropout rates, and professional development. CONCLUSIONS: Medical school is a time of significant psychological distress for physicians-in-training. Currently available information is insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the causes and consequences of student distress. Large, prospective, multicenter studies are needed to identify personal and training-related features that influence depression, anxiety, and burnout among students and explore relationships between distress and competency.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Stress is an important disorder that affects the health of world-wide people. Recent evidence indicates that the level of stress is related to specific personality profiles. In particular, medical residents are exposed to high stress levels. Objective. To determine the relationship between personality profiles and stress levels in medical residents. Material and methods. A prospective, transversal, correlational and descriptive study was assembled with 61 medical residents. Two psychological tests were used: 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire and Nowack's stress profile; followed by a psychological interview. Results. 50% of medical residents showed medium to high levels. Correlation analyses indicate that stress is associated with specific personality profiles, such as: C- (low emotional stability; r = -0.337; P = 0.008), H- (shyness; r = -0.313; P = 0.014), O+ (self-guiltiness; r = 0.298; P = 0.02) and Q4+ (recklessness; r = 0.474, P = 0.001). Factors H and Q4 were related to high levels of stress. Conclusions. A half of medical residents showed important stress levels. The personality profile C-H- O+ Q4+ describes people with low tolerance to frustration, high concern to be accepted by others, which is associated to inferiority complex and high levels of nervous tension that may affect their professional performance.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Study 1 explored whether a brief mindfulness intervention was superior to a traditional relaxation intervention for nursing staff. Results demonstrated that both interventions significantly improved relaxation and life satisfaction, with mindfulness participants exhibiting a trend toward particular improvements in emotional exhaustion. In study 2, teacher trainees who participated in a Mindfulness-Based Wellness Education (MBWE) program as part of their academic training experienced significantly greater increases than controls in mindfulness, satisfaction with life, and teaching self-efficacy. We recognize that systemic factors need to be addressed for the long-term resolution of stress-related problems among human services professionals. In the interim, mindfulness-based interventions are proving to be an effective way to support these pivotal members of our society. Human services professionals are pivotal members of our society. They often work under duress and as a result, stress related health and mental health problems commonly lead to job burnout in this population (Maslach 2003). In addition to the negative physical and mental health outcomes associated with stress and burnout, there are also substantial financial costs to organizations as a result of decreased work performance and increased disability, absenteeism, and turnover (Palmer et al 2004; Statistics Canada 2007). Across human services professions, the causes and consequences of stress, as well as factors contributing to one's ability to cope with stress or to develop burnout, are well documented (e.g., for nurses, see Gelsema et al 2006; for social workers, see Seibert 2005; for teachers, see Montgomery & Rupp 2005). Theoretical models map out the factors contributing to, and the trajectory leading toward, outcomes such as burnout (e.g., Bakker & Demerouti 2007). However, the literature focusing on solutions to work-related stress and burnout is scant (Maslach 2003). This article outlines the development and evaluation of two mindfulness-based interventions for human services professionals. These programs are based on evidence of impressive benefits of Kabat-Zinn's (1990) mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program in clinical settings, burgeoning interest in applying this program in non-clinical settings, and our own mindfulness practices. After a brief overview of mindfulness and current research developments, we describe the results of two studies we conducted, one with nurses and one with teachers-in-training.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Even minimal unilateral hearing loss can hinder educational performance. We investigated the prevalence of ear diseases among secondary school students in the city of Xi'an, China in order to provide a foundation for evidence-based hearing healthcare. Methods: A stratified random sampling survey was conducted in 29 secondary schools. Demographics and medical histories were collected, and otologic examinations were performed. Questionnaires were administered to assess insomnia, academic stress and use of portable audio devices. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with hearing impairment, and the association of sensorineural hearing loss with insomnia, academic stress and the use of portable audio devices was analyzed with the chi-square test. Results: The percentage of students with some form of ear disease was 3.32%. External ear disease, middle ear disease and sensorineural hearing loss occurred in 1.21%, 0.64% and 1.47% of the students, respectively. Boys had a relatively higher prevalence of ear disease than girls. According to our survey, the prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss increased significantly among the students with insomnia and extended use of portable audio devices, but not among those with elevated levels of academic stress. Hearing aids and surgical treatment were needed in 1.47% and 0.89% of the students, respectively. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of ear disease among secondary school students, and this should be given more attention. Insomnia and the excessive use of portable audio devices may be related to adolescent sensorineural hearing loss. It is important to establish and comply with an evidence-based preventive strategy. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Across all three semesters, 49%, 65%, and 69% of the participants reported depression levels at or above the clinical cut-off, suggesting a remarkably high percentage of students experiencing significant levels of depression symptoms. Further, this study investigated the relationship between common stressors experienced by veterinary students and mental health, general health, and academic performance. A factor analysis revealed four factors among stressors common to veterinary students: academic stress, transitional stress, family-health stress, and relationship stress. The results indicated that both academic stress and transitional stress had a robust impact on veterinary medical students' well-being during their first three semesters of study. As well, academic stress negatively impacted students in the areas of depression and anxiety symptoms, life satisfaction, general health, perception of academic performance, and grade point average (GPA). Transitional stress predicted increased depression and anxiety symptoms and decreased life satisfaction. This study helped to further illuminate the magnitude of the problem of depression and anxiety symptoms in veterinary medical students and identified factors most predictive of poor outcomes in the areas of mental health, general health, and academic performance. The discussion provides recommendations for considering structural changes to veterinary educational curricula to reduce the magnitude of academic stressors. Concurrently, recommendations are suggested for mental health interventions to help increase students' resistance to environmental stressors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

In recent years, mental stress has been on the rise and this may affect their learning and academic performances. They face tremendous competition and fear of failure. Very few studies on this subject have been reported by Indian researchers. Objectives: To study the levels of psychological stress and its relationship with personal/ curricular variables in undergraduate medical students. Materials and Methods: Setting: Descriptive cross sectional study in undergraduate medical students. Sample size: 251 students Scores used in the study: The scores have been given on the basis of the Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale [PSLES]. Statistical test used: Chi-square test Results: 42.63% of the study subjects had experienced less/moderate stress and 47.01% of them had experienced severe stress. 78.26% of the smokers and 68.97% of the alcoholics had severe stress. The statistical association between the history of alcohol intake, smoking and the PSLES results was found to be significant. The stress was found to be more among repeaters and the association between them was statistically significant. Conclusion: The students with psychological stress were found to be involved in habits like tobacco chewing and smoking, as well as alcohol intake. The repeater students had significantly higher stress as compared to their regular batch counterparts.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Psychological morbidity and associated sources of stress have not been investigated extensively in physiotherapy students. This study explored sources of stress, psychological morbidity and possible associations between these variables in undergraduate physiotherapy students. Design: A questionnaire-based survey. The Undergraduate Sources of Stress Questionnaire was used to identify sources of stress, and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) was used to rate the prevalence of psychological morbidity, using a conservative GHQ threshold of 3 to 4 to determine probable 'cases'. Uni- and multivariate tests of correlation were used to analyse the data. Setting: An Irish educational institution. Participants: One hundred and twenty-five physiotherapy undergraduate students. Results: More than one-quarter of all students (27%) scored above the GHQ threshold, indicating probable psychological morbidity. This is higher than the level of psychological morbidity reported by the general population. Regression analysis showed that academic (β= 0.31, P< 0.001) and personal (β= 0.50, P< 0.001) sources of stress subscales were significant coefficients, explaining 48% of the variance in psychological morbidity after controlling for part-time employment and hours spent studying. Individual significant items from these subscales were stressful events (β= 0.24, P= 0.004), mood (β= 0.43, P≤ 0.001) and overall level of stress (β= 0.35, P≤ 0.001). Conclusions: The results highlighted the emotional vulnerability of a significant proportion of physiotherapy students, with academic and personal issues being the greatest concern. While personal causes of stress such as stressful events and mood are more difficult to control, manipulation of curricular factors may have positive effects on academic sources of stress. © 2010 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The quasi-experimental design of the study involved a control group together with a pretest and a posttest, and several demographic and experiential variables. The study used a version of the Mental Retardation Attitude Inventory-Revised that Kandari and Salih (in press) adapted for the Kuwaiti culture. Results revealed that the course did not influence students' attitudes toward individuals with MR. The authors discussed the findings in relation to determining the changes needed in the course's curriculum and evaluating the information provided for prospective educators in order for them to support the integration of individuals with MR into mainstream society. Throughout history, society's attitude towards individuals with Mental Retardation (MR) has been predominantly negative. Society has created an ‘out-group’ of people who may be seen as less than human because they are disadvantaged in terms of some abilities and characteristics such as intelligence, self-consciousness, and the ability to have human relationship that the majority of its citizens possess. The history of segregation of individuals with MR has reinforced this notion by adopting the term ‘handicap’ or ‘disability,’ which signifies the presence of an inherent difference between them and other people. Such segregation can negate the fact that one is a human being; depriving him\her of enjoying the benefits afforded to those without disabilities (Philip, 1992). Smith (1981) provides an example of the danger of society's beliefs about individuals with MR as being less than human. He brings to attention that fetuses with Downs syndrome are usually aborted because, when they are born, they would not meet certain minimum requirements for being human. They would be severely mentally retarded and uneducable, and would thus be a burden on their families and society. The danger of such beliefs is that individuals with MR may begin to internalize these inaccurate assumptions and thus tend to fulfill the society's expectations (Phillip, 1992). Over the last few decades, a strong movement in special education and related human services fields toward ‘normalization’ has given people with MR more opportunities to participate in various activities with people without disabilities. Changes in the provision of services to persons with disabilities have focused on increased inclusion in educational, employment, and social arenas (Antonak & Livneh, 1988). However, barriers, including the attitudes of educators, employers, co-workers, and others, still stand between persons with MR and full inclusion (Geskie & Salesk, 1988). In Kuwait, the law of the disabled (13\96) assures the right of persons with disabilities to be included in different settings (e.g., schools, workplace, social activities, and wider community). Although Kuwaiti government has shown growing interest in the integration of individuals with MR, the chances of these individuals to integrate into mainstream society would depend on the attitudes of others (e.g. students, prospective educators, teachers, co-workers, social workers, professionals) toward them. These attitudes, as found in many Western studies (e.g. Antonak & Harth, 1994; Gordon, Tantillo, Feldman & Perrone, 2004) are for the most part negative, which may contribute to negative outcomes on the part of individuals with MR (Byon, 2000, Special Olympics, 2003). For example, Parent, Hill and Wehman (1989) found that non-disabled co-workers focused on the disabled personal characteristics rather than specific job competencies. The impact of these negative attitudes may have significant consequences for both social and vocational lives of persons with MR. Mest (1988) have found that negative attitude leads to self-isolation of persons with MR. Rusch, Hughes, Johnson and Minch (1991) found that stigma negatively affected social relationships between workers with MR and their peers without MR. As literature has shown, the provision of educational and social opportunities for individuals with disabilities can be legislated, but acceptance from other people cannot be ensured. Experts agree that complete integration and acceptance of individuals with disabilities might happen following long-term changes in attitudes (Beattie, Anderson & Antonak, 1997). According to Langer's (1989) theory of ‘mindfulness’, changing people's attitude depends on providing enough information relevant to the problem of interest. People change their understanding of concepts based on their becoming mindful of them. Taba (1966) suggests that concepts' formation involves three stages: (1) Identifying information relevant to a problem, (2) grouping information on the basis of some similarity, and (3) developing categories and labels for the groups (Taba, 1966). With regard to MR, people might change their attitudes if they are encouraged to identify the construct of MR and then group subsequent information with enough details to form groups of categories without simply stereotyping. This is because people usually stereotype others and judge them without enough information and reflection (Langer, 1989). Thus, only continued mindfulness toward individuals with MR can eliminate stereotypical thinking and lead to their acceptance as fellow human beings in various settings. Gordon, Feldman, Tantillo, and Perrone (2004) suggested that greater awareness of disability issues results in improving social attitudes about disabilities and helps in removing attitudinal barriers. Henry, Keys, Balcazar, and Jopp (1996) also found evidence that training in inclusion philosophy increases awareness associated with positive inclusion's attitudes among staff members who work in mental disability settings, when compared to general population. There is some evidence showing that as they gain more information about individuals with MR and their conditions, their attitudes become more positive (Lawrence, Glidden & M-Jobe, 2006; Sadek & Sadek, 2000). Conaster and Block (2001) found that instructors who taught aquatics classes to students with disabilities felt able to handle their academic coursework and experiences during the academic year. Teachers who felt competent had also more favorable beliefs and positive attitudes toward individuals with disabilities. In a related finding, Irish physical educators showed significant positive attitudes related to their previous experiences in teaching students with mild-moderate MR (Meegan & Macphail, 2006). Folsom-Meek and Rizzo (2002) claimed that educational preparation helps to enhance attitudes toward working with individuals with disabilities. Castoria (1986) found that understanding of the intent and concept of mainstreaming, and adequate-to-good training emerged as positive factors that influenced elementary and junior high school teachers' attitudes toward youngsters with special-needs. Based on the above arguments, perceptions and attitudes of prospective educators can be enhanced by the provision of appropriate coursework related to disabilities. Otherwise, prospective educators would continue, like many people, to believe that individuals with MR are not capable of dealing with the everyday facets of life (Hunt, 2004). More seriously, educators may feel uncomfortable dealing with students with MR who happen to enroll in their classes. A study of community attitudes in one state of Australia found that up to 86% of respondents reported feeling ‘uncomfortable’ when interacting with individuals with disabilities (Enhance Management, 1999). Another study (European Commission, 2001) found that 40% of Europeans reported feeling ‘uneasy’ in the presence of people with disabilities. The coursework would thus help to increase prospective educators' willingness to work with individuals with MR, interact with them, and support their integration into society (Horne, 1985). Lack of interest and negative attitudes on the part of prospective educators may directly influence their abilities to interact with individuals with MR in a disability-related job (Schlachter & Duckitt, 2002). Hatton, Emerson, Rivers, Mason, Swarbrick and Mason (2001) claimed that lack of interest in MR by staff members (e.g., social workers, counselors) usually discourages them from dealing with individuals with MR, and may result in their leaving the job. Although researchers (e.g. Hatton, Emerson, Rivers, Mason, Swarbrick and Mason, 2001; Larson and Lakin, 1999) found that low salary and high job stress can lead staff members to leave their jobs, Osborne and Williams (1982) indicated that lack of interest in MR was the major reason of leaving the job among social workers. Providing coursework related to disabilities increases prospective educators' awareness of disability. Gaining this awareness, they can identify and counter inequality of opportunities for individuals with MR, inaccessibility of resources, and other environmental influences that add to their powerlessness. Prospective educators usually play an active role in social change and in changing public opinion. The awareness of the disability would help them to change society's response to persons with MR, as it is affected less by public policy and more by the prevailing societal attitudes. Myers, Ager, Kerr, and Myles (1998) suggested that increasing people's awareness of individuals with disabilities would present them as having worth and value as human beings no matter how they may differ from what society considered the “norm”. Prospective educators need to become aware of handicapist language, stereotypes, and prejudices that exist in literature so that they might better promote understanding and appreciation of people with disabilities. A course dealing with disabilities would be helpful for educators to encourage understanding by accurately and respectfully portraying well-adjusted and productive individuals with MR, due to the fact that most literature presents and reinforces prejudicial and stereotypical images of characters with MR (Catlett, Martin, and Craig, 1993; Marsh, 2003). As part of the graduation requirements, Kuwait University requires prospective educators in the Social Work Department to take courses that focus on provision of educational, social and health services to special needs groups, such as the Social Work With Disabilities (SWWD) course which has two broad goals: (a) To increase prospective educators' knowledge of individuals with disabilities, and (b) to improve prospective educators' skills to deal with individuals with disabilities in the jobsites. These goals are accomplished through a combination of presenting information, guest speakers and direct contact with the instructor. Although the course deals with different types of disabilities (learning disabilities, MR, behavior and emotional disorders, and physical disability), the present study focuses on MR and students' attitudes toward them. In a study of Ahmad (2004) in Kuwait, findings showed that 40% of respondents in 15 workplaces related to mental disabilities reported a shortage of Kuwaiti professionals (social workers, counselors, psychologists) who work with the individuals with MR, and 46.7% of them reported lack of volunteers who are in direct contact with those individuals. Most research on attitudes toward MR in educational settings has focused on assessing attitudes of individuals (e.g., Lyons & Hayes, 1993; Corrigan, Green, Lundin, Kubiak, & Penn, 2001), with little attention given to effective strategies to promote positive attitudes toward individuals with MR. The assessment of attitude of prospective educators and whether it is affected by the SWWD course is important for several reasons. First, as educators, we have the opportunity to evaluate the course with regard to an important learning outcome. This evaluation could lead to a deeper analysis of the students' learning needs, and modification of the course's performance objectives, instructional materials, instructional strategies, and assessment strategies (Miller, 1996). Second, knowing whether the course has an effect on changing students' attitude would thus help professionals and social service providers to know whether educators would have the potential to contribute to or hinder the independence of persons with MR (Antonak & Livneh, 1988). Third, as the service model in Kuwait begins to emphasize the role of persons with MR in designing and requesting services that foster independency, the role of prospective educators in this process is likely to be affected by their attitudes as an intervening variable or variable that might indirectly influences behavior (Miller, 1996). Negative attitudes, as an intervening variable, might not directly cause negative behavior toward individuals with MR, but is likely to affect behavior in an indirect way, and hence affect the opportunity for inclusion in the lives of persons with MR. Attitude can motivate behavior in either a dynamic or directive manner (Miller, 1996). The broad question of the present study was: Would teaching the SWWD course improve prospective educators' attitudes toward individuals with MR? The present study investigated this question by assessing the attitudes of prospective educators (experimental group) toward individuals with MR before and after studying the course. The study also assessed the attitudes of another group of students (control group) who were, at the same time, taking another course. The present study anticipated that the attitudes of prospective educators toward individuals with MR would become positively different, as they gain more information about MR during the course of study. We thus hypothesized that taking the SWWD would improve attitude of a prospective educator toward people with MR. 2007 Policy Studies Organization","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This research aimed to evaluate the process and outcomes of OSCE from the perspective of the major stakeholder groups: first and second year nursing students, lecturers, clinical placement coordinators and assessors. A utilisation focussed evaluation approach was adopted which values the opinions and experiences of stakeholders. It is intended to use the findings to develop the validity and quality of the OSCE assessment. The OSCE process was found to have a positive impact on all stakeholders. OSCEs were perceived to be a meaningful and fair form of assessment. Students identified that they felt more prepared for and more confident about forthcoming placements. The OSCE process was, however, perceived to be a stressful experience and requires considerable preparation effort by students and academic staff. Mature students claimed that more practice effort was required but also felt more prepared for placements and achieved higher OSCE scores. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It may also involve the longing for more social interaction than being experienced at a certain time. Loneliness is thus a social construct. Although loneliness affects such a large part of the population that it is regarded as a universal phenomenon and as part and parcel of the human condition, the pain associated with loneliness may have serious consequences. Various studies indicate that young people (particularly those between 18 and 25 years of age) are especially prone to loneliness and that they should accordingly be the focus of new studies on the condition. At the root of their isolation lie the uncertain political situation, the lack of leadership in the country, a high incidence of child abuse, rape, sexual abuse, incest and violence. A hazard of social isolation is that it has been found to be a risk factor for a wide variety of problems, such as high levels of psychological stress, negative affect and consequent poor psychological well-being which lead to depression, suicide, animosity, alcoholism and psychosomatic illnesses. In other words, loneliness has both physical and psychological implications, many of which could be long term. Although it is impossible to prevent loneliness, the condition may be alleviated by cultivating social awareness on the prevalence and consequences of loneliness and doing research on the effect and influence of culture and the community on the prevalence and alleviation of loneliness. (Most current research focuses on the individual and does not consider the complexity of the South African context.) A range of factors influence the extent of people's loneliness in South African society where many cultures and races may deal with the phenomenon of loneliness in different ways. Rokach's (1988) model of the predictors of loneliness is the basis for the identification of factors that cause and contribute to loneliness. This model is subdivided into three broad categories that influence the feeling of loneliness: problems with relationships, traumatic experiences and personal and developmental variables. These categories may be subdivided into eight factors that increase loneliness. Although this is a holistic model, other factors that were not mentioned by Rokach were included in order to make the study more complete. In this study the following predictors of loneliness are discussed: • Personality: The following factors that contribute to loneliness are mentioned in this article: anxiety, an inability to assert oneself and hyper-sensitivity. A poor self concept, an external locus of control and shyness are other aspects of the personality that contribute to loneliness. Additional characteristics have been found to be common among lonely people: isolated people are generally suspicious, imaginative, radical, self-sufficient, tense and dominating. They are also more emotionally mature, are inclined to feel guilty and are less sociable than others. • Affect: Loneliness is linked to negative affect and is typified in conditions such as depression, boredom, hopelessness, aggression, stress, anger, restlessness and tension. • Depression: A complicated vicious circle makes diagnosis tricky: people with poor social skills are more inclined to become depressed and yet depressed people are inclined to be lonely. The differences between loneliness and depression are explained. • Problems in relationships: A lack of feelings of belonging, support and intimacy caused by poor communication promote loneliness. Social estrangement and separation and rejection also contribute to loneliness. • Marital status: Married people usually feel less lonely - but this is not the case when marriages are unfulfilling. Loneliness in marriage is linked to a lack of intimacy. Major changes that promote social isolation consist of events such as leaving home, a new career, separation from loved ones, breaking off a major relationship and moving house. • Illness or physical disability may lead to limited contact with other people. Research indicates that HIV/AIDS and eating disorders isolate the sufferers from social contact. • Religious faith correlates negatively with loneliness. However, religions with strict behavioural prescriptions are likely to isolate individuals from free social interaction. This could result in loneliness. • Academic achievement: Research indicates that students whose academic performance is poor are more likely to be lonely. • Leisure activities that alienate people from each other are watching television and surfing the Internet. While it is impossible to avoid loneliness completely, it may be alleviated. The recommendation is made that contributory factors towards loneliness should be investigated because knowledge of these may substantially lessen the impact of loneliness on people's mental health status.Such knowledge should be available to therapists and psychologists so that preventative programmes may be designed and implemented, particularly to assist in the prevention of suicide, substance abuse and stress. This will contribute to an improved quality of life, productivity and health for those afflicted and particularly for South African youth.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The data of 2062 women and 2231 men was derived from the prospective unselected population-based Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort study. Results of linear regression models showed that being female, father's low socioeconomic position, and poor academic achievement in adolescence were linked to low control and high job strain jobs at age 31, and that low control and high job strain were associated with psychological distress at age 31. Although having lower school grades, high absence rate from school, and moderate alcohol consumption at age 14 were significant predictors of psychological distress at age 31, the associations between job control, job strain and psychological distress remained after controlling for these and other pre-employment effects. As such, pre-employment factors do seem to link people to risky work environments, which in turn seem to relate strongly to psychological distress.

Mental health is one of the leading contributors to the burden of disease in Australia with anxiety and depression significant in presentations. The wellbeing and mental health of university students is a cause for concern in the provision of student affairs and services in universities and colleges. Student wellbeing and mental health has considerable impact on academic performance and the 'at risk' management for both student and the university community. The present study examined the prevalence of mental health problems and general wellbeing amongst university students enrolled at one Australian university and explored academic stress and the likely impact on student mental health and wellbeing. The article specifically reports the results of measures included in a Student Wellbeing Survey conducted in 2009 at an Australian university. The survey respondents completed measures of general distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale), mental health (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales), under conditions of low versus high stress (varied by proximity to examinations). The findings revealed that students' level of psychological distress at the start of semester was higher than expected and that with increasing academic stress, students exhibited increased levels of psychological distress, anxiety, stress, and depression. Implications for service provision are discussed.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Student assistance programs (SAPs) are services provided to students through a contractual arrangement to the university or college as a part of student services. The goal is to address psychosocial concerns that may interfere with academic performance within the realm of short-term counseling. These services range from traditional behavioral health concerns about stress and depressive reactions to how to find child care with foreign-speaking services.

These include the development of a generic job description, a logbook to monitor training outcomes and a national network of supervisors to plan and oversee intern training. To get feedback on the impact of these reforms, the Medical Council surveyed all interns with Irish addresses in March 2003. Three hundred (65%) of 461 interns responded. The majority provided positive feedback on many aspects of their education and training, their work environment and professional relationships. However, a majority also reported a lack of protected time for education, a lack of formal educational programmes, insufficient feedback on performance and an unnecessarily stressful work environment. Overall, 61% reported being bullied and 4% had experienced sexual harassment.

Suboptimal cognitive functioning in caregivers may have profound implications. Methods: Fifty-four spousal caregivers of dementia patients from the Memory Clinic of the Academic Hospital Maastricht and the Regional Institute for Community Mental Health Care in the Netherlands were compared with 108 non-caregiving controls. Data were collected on patient and caregiver characteristics and caregiver cognitive functioning. Repeated measures statistical analyses were carried out to investigate the relationship between caregiver cognitive functioning at baseline and patient behavioural problems and caregiver competence during 1 year of follow-up. Results: Caregivers performed significantly worse on several cognitive domains compared with control subjects. Low performance on a verbal memory task was related to a decrease in caregiver subjective competence and an increase in patient hyperactivity. Conclusion: The results indicate that screening for cognitive impairment of spousal caregivers may be helpful, because suboptimal cognitive functioning may affect the ability to provide adequate care. © Copyright 2006 Oxford University Press.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Study design: In a prospective observational study, parents of 58 children with NF1 (32 boys, 26 girls, age 12.2 ± 2.5 years) visiting a university clinic, and their 43 children 10 years or older were assessed with the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). Potential determinants of domain scores were assessed in 3 explorative regression models. Results: Parents reported a significant impact of NF1 on 9/13 CHQ scales, with moderate effect sizes on 8 (general health perceptions, physical functioning, general behavior, mental health, self esteem, family activities, role functioning emotional/behavioral, and parent emotional impact). Children report an impact on bodily pain, and an above average general behavior. Multiple CHQ scales were sensitive to demographic factors and behavioral problems, and 1 to NF1 severity. NF1 visibility and school problems did not influence HR-QOL. Conclusions: Parents, but not the children with NF1, report a profound impact of NF1 on physical, social, behavioral, and emotional aspects of HR-QOL. Multiple HR-QOL domains were most sensitive to behavioral problems, which points to an exciting potential opportunity to improve HR-QOL in children with NF1 by addressing these behavioral problems. © 2009 Mosby, Inc.

The mental hygiene in the medical field is maintained when individuals can play in a manner suited their personal and professional capacities under appropriate conditions of psychic and social welfare. This stimulates like no other the transmission and perpetuation of attitudes, which then will have an impact on the community. Because of the association of depressive symptoms with consequences such as desertion from the faculty of medicine, suicidal ideation and suicide, low academic performance, impact on the capabilities of patient care, (among others, believes that early identification of individuals at risk is of great importance for public health and preventive psychiatry. Material and methods: We conducted a descriptive survey study in 229 type of postgraduate students studying medicine at the Military School of Graduate Health to assess the study variables: anxiety, depression and stress. Results. In the present study we conclude that in the values mentioned regarding depression, the prevalence of depression in graduate students belonging to the Military School of Graduate Health is higher than reported in the literature (p < 0.05). Discusion. With regard to the anxiety and stress, our hypothesis is ruled to have values similar to those reported in the literature so that the prevalence of anxiety and stress of graduate students of the Military School of Graduate Health is similar to as reported in the literature. Conclusions. It is important to note this as a health issue, which would negatively affect the performance, and it is shown that by intervening in it in a timely manner would reduce the thoughts of concern and would prevent the deterioration of performance in people with this problem. Diagnosis and treatment of the disease, central goals of medicine, has been gradually giving way to an interest in reducing the costs of their direct care, the number of lives and years of life lost, as well as for the human suffering patient as his family. In this regard, the new focus on the health of modern medicine, preferably pointing towards preventive objectives, with full participation and responsibility of the population.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study investigated 101 public high schools in southeastern Michigan to examine the role played by the availability of nearby nature in student academic achievement and behavior. The analyses revealed consistent and systematically positive relationships between nature exposure and student performance. Specifically, views with greater quantities of trees and shrubs from cafeteria as well as classroom windows are positively associated with standardized test scores, graduation rates, percentages of students planning to attend a four-year college, and fewer occurrences of criminal behavior. In addition, large expanses of landscape lacking natural features are negatively related to these same test scores and college plans. These featureless landscapes included large areas of campus lawns, athletic fields, and parking lots.

Design: Descriptive correlational cross-sectional survey. Setting: Academic tertiary care children's hospital and pediatric specialty orthopedic hospital in the intermountain West. Participants: A total of 51 parents or guardians who provide the majority of daily care in their homes for their children with CP between the ages of 5 and 18 years. Methods: Survey of a convenience sample of parents of children with CP. Main Outcome Measurements: (1) Short-form 36 Health Survey v2.0 to measure parent mental and physical health; (2) Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory v4.0 to measure the physical, social, school, emotional and psychosocial function, and total quality of life of their children with CP; (3) Gross Motor Function Classification System to assess severity of the child's CP; (4) Parenting Stress Index; (5) Family Environment Scale, relationship dimension; and (6) Self-Efficacy for Parenting Tasks Index. Results: Positive correlations were found between parent physical health and the physical function of their children with CP (r = 0.32) and between parent mental health and the emotional function (r = 0.46), psychosocial function (r = 0.40), and total health-related quality of life (r = 0.38) of their children. When adjusting for severity of CP, we found that parenting stress and parenting self-efficacy attenuated these relationships to varying degrees. Conclusions: A clear positive correlation was found between the function of parents and the function of their children with CP. Although a cross-sectional study does not demonstrate the direction of the relationship, it seems reasonable to conclude that clinicians who are attempting to directly maximize child function should also consider the potential value of interventions that support and improve parent function, particularly mental health. © 2011 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

At no other time during the life span were suicide rates so high. Suicide among college and university students is estimated by some to be 50% higher than for other Americans of comparable age (Westefeld & Pattilo, 1987). Not only is suicide considered by many authors to be the number one health problem on the nation's campuses (Mathiasen, 1988), but the suicide rate for this population has tripled over the past 25 years (Hardin & Weast, 1989). Professional nursing students could perhaps be at an even higher risk for suicide than other college students. Manicini, Lavecchia, and Clegg point out that ""[n]ursing students are more doubtful than other college students about their academic performance. They encounter stress in adjusting to a rigorous program of theory and practice. The reality is often far different from a prospective student's image of it"" (cited in Lampkin, Cannon, & Fairchild, 1985, p. 148). Because of the longevity of contact hours spent with nursing students in both lecture and clinical milieus, nursing faculty are in a uniquely favorable position to identify and assess those students who appear to be at risk for suicide. In addition, as most nurse educators provide supportive relationships, rich with caring and trust for their students, distressed students are usually open to talking to a faculty member. If a suicidal risk is found during the assessment interview, the faculty member should then provide an immediate referral for further psychiatric evaluation and intervention. To assist faculty in the quick recall of the essential components of this helping process the acronym S.A.V.E. is used: 1. S: Suicidal behaviors. 2. A: Assessment interview. 3. V: Value student. 4.

The influence of occupation and the worksite has emerged as an important area of study in research on alcohol consumption. Occupational and nonoccupational factors were studied in relation to alcohol consumption using data from a 1983-1985 cross-sectional study of transit operators. Methods. A total of 1,853 operators underwent a medical examination for driver′s license renewal (including information on age, ethnicity, gender, education). of these operators, 1,448 completed a questionnaire about occupational (e.g., time of shift, job stressors) and nonoccupational (e.g., personality, life stressors) factors. From either the medical examination or the questionnaire, weekly alcohol consumption was available for 1,820 operators. Variables related to alcohol consumption in previous studies, or theoretically linked to consumption, were analyzed in relation to heavy (≥15 drinks/week) and average weekly consumption. Results. Heavy and average consumption were both related to several nonoccupational variables, including demographic (age, ethnicity, gender, marital status), personality (depression, anger expression), and life stress variables (i.e., life events). Heavy and average consumption were also related to several occupational variables, including job history (number of years driving, specific worksite) and job stressors. Neither measure was related to subjective job content (job demand, decision latitude). Conclusions. Variability in consumption by demographic factors among this population reflects that seen in society as a whole. However, occupational factors may influence consumption, since consumption was strongly related to (a) specific worksite and time of shift and (b) reported job stressors. Clarifying the exact influence of occupational and worksite factors on alcohol consumption will depend on the convergence of findings from different research designs (e.g., cross-sectional, longitudinal, ethnographic). © 1995 Academic Press.

We live in a world that has limited resources. The health care industry faces this limitation more than any other industry. With these challenges facing health care administrators, the concept of productivity, job satisfaction and motivation become very important. Employee satisfaction and retention have always been an important issue for physicians, medical centers and businesses in general. Conventional human resources theories, developed some 50 years ago by Maslow and Herzberg, suggest that satisfied employees tend to be more productive, creative and committed to their employers. People are essential to productivity. The success of productivity improvement strategy is dependent on employee commitment, job satisfaction, skills, and motivation. Maslow's theory consists of a 5-level pyramid: physiologic or basic survival; physical and mental safety; sense of belonging; accomplishment, creativity, and growth; and self-actualization. Herzberg's theory suggests there are 2 groups of factors: hygiene (which satisfy) and motivation. The terms ""job satisfaction"" and ""motivation"" have, in my experience, become used interchangeably. There is a difference. Job satisfaction is an individual's emotional response to his or her current job condition, while motivation is the driving force to pursue and satisfy one's needs. Maslow and Herzberg's theories can be easily applied to the workplace. Managers can help employees achieve overall job satisfaction, which, with the employee's internal motivation drive, increase performance on the job.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Men and women did not differ in primary diagnosis, type of complaint, problem areas, or type of termination. However, women reported more depressive and total symptomatology, and men were more likely to receive a secondary diagnosis of personality disorder and evidenced a particular excess of obsessive-compulsive disorders. Men often requested treatment following a relationship loss or when school performance fell short of expectations. Women were frequently struggling to reconcile career desires with a feminine identification and with affiliation needs.

An apparent increase in seriously disturbed students consulting student health services in the UK has led to concern that increasing financial difficulties and other outside pressures may affect student mental health and academic performance. The current research investigated whether student anxiety and depression increases after college entry, the extent to which adverse life experiences contribute to any increases, and the impact of adversity, anxiety and depression on exam performance. Method. 351 UK-domiciled undergraduates completed questionnaires one month before university entry and mid-course. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS: Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) was administered at both time points and a modified List of Threatening Experiences (Brugha, Bebbington, Tennant, & Hurry, 1985) was administered mid-course. Results. By mid-course 9% of previously symptom-free students became depressed and 20% became anxious at a clinically significant level. Of those previously anxious or depressed 36% had recovered. After adjusting for pre-entry symptoms, financial difficulties made a significant independent contribution to depression and relationship difficulties independently predicted anxiety. Depression and financial difficulties mid-course predicted a decrease in exam performance from first to second year. Conclusions. This is the first study to confirm empirically that financial and other difficulties can increase British students' levels of anxiety and depression and that financial difficulties and depression can affect academic performance. However, university life may also have a beneficial effect for some students with pre-existing conditions. With widening participation in higher education, the results have important implications for educational and health policies.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Although surgical trainees will be dramatically affected by these changes, no comprehensive assessment of their well-being has been recently attempted. Study design A multicenter study of psychological well-being of surgical residents (n = 108) across four US training programs before implementation of the 80-hour work week was performed using two validated surveys (Symptom Checklist-90-R [SCL-90-R] and Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]) during academic year 2002-03. Societal normative populations served as controls. Primary outcomes measures were psychologic distress (SCL-90-R) and perceived stress (PSS). Secondary outcomes measures (SCL-90-R) were somatization, depression, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, obsessive-compulsive behavior, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. The impact of personal variables (age, gender, marital status) and programmatic variables (level of training, laboratory experience, institution) was assessed. Results Mean psychologic distress was significantly higher in general surgery residents than in the normative population (p < 0.0001), with 38% scoring above the 90 th percentile and 72% above the 50th percentile. Mean perceived stress among surgery residents was higher than historic controls (p < 0.0001), with 21% scoring above the 90th percentile and 68% above the 50th percentile. Among secondary outcomes, eight of nine symptom dimensions were significantly higher in surgical residents than in societal controls. In subgroup analyses, male gender was associated with phobic anxiety (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p < 0.05), and junior level of training (PGY 1 to 3) with anxiety (p < 0.05), obsessive-compulsive behavior (p < 0.05), and interpersonal sensitivity (p < 0.05). Conclusions More than one-third of general surgery residents meet criteria for clinical psychologic distress. Surgery residents perceive significantly more stress than societal controls. Both personal and programmatic variables likely affect resident well-being and should be considered in assessing the full impact of Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education directives and in guiding future restructuring efforts. © 2004 by the American College of Surgeons.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The study was based on a series of questionnaires given at enrolment and subsequently at the end of the second term, the end of the first year and after the end of the second year. The validity of student self-assessment of mental illness (SMl) was examined and found established on the basis of reproducibility in a subsequent 1970 cohort of 2, 038 students, stability, correlation with neuroticism score (EPI), correlation with psychosomatic symptoms, health service assessments, and non-correlation with sick role inclination. SMI of varying severity and duration was experienced by 38 per cent of first year students and 49 per cent of second year students. It was more frequent among females than males-SMI was strongly correlated with high subjective life stress, loneliness, changes of personal values, membership of the Arts faculty and living in a flat or rented room. Life situational factors of this kind were more significant for females than males. Socio-demographic data collected at enrolment were less strongly correlated with SMI, but self-assessment of previous ill health, personality (including particularly neuroticism as measured by the EPI), difficulty in discussion of problems with family, and dissatisfaction with school academic performance were the most relevant.Poor mental health was positively correlated with poor examination performance and subsequent withdrawal from university. The SMI help-seeking rate was positively correlated with the severity of the illness. The findings of this study in an Australian university are similar to previous studies of students from Edinburgh and Harvard Universities. It is concluded that the epidemiological study of the mental health of students can be effectively undertaken through student self-assessment, and provides important indications for prevention. © 1974 Oxford University Press.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

An 11-item scale was created for parents' use to evaluate the influence of epilepsy on the major aspects of their family and child's life. This will be a helpful tool both in the clinical setting and as an outcome measure for research studies. Methods: Mothers rated their child's quality of life on a visual analogue scale (1-6) and completed the Impact of Pediatric Epilepsy Scale (IPES), which assesses the impact on academic achievement, participation in activities, health, relationships with family and with peers and siblings, social activities, self-esteem, and the caregiver's hopes for their child's future adapted from the scale developed by Jacoby. External validation was determined by comparison of the IPES with physicians' reports of the characteristics of the child's epilepsy and neurological limitations and parents' ratings on the Family Environment Scale or Parenting Stress Index. In addition, each school-aged child completed the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, Brother-Sister Questionnaire, and Loneliness Scale. Teachers of children completed the Academic Performance Rating Scale. Seven days later, retest reliability of the IPES was evaluated. Results: Ninety-seven mothers of children aged 2-16 years completed the IPES and the appropriate family and age-related questionnaires. Internal validation on the IPES yielded a Cronbach's a for the scale of 0.92. A significant Pearson's correlation indicated that total scores were consistent over time (r = 0.81). Spearman's correlations for the individual items were also significant, ranging from 0.48 to 0.78. Significant Spearman's correlations also indicated that quality of life was negatively related to impact on each of the 11 items of psychosocial function. Children with IPES scores above the median differed in some psychosocial aspects from those who scored below. Their parents were more stressed, their siblings were more respectful, they had lower self-esteem, and they experienced more emotional problems. Total impact was also significantly related to seizure frequency, total number of medications taken, number of visits to a physician in the previous year, and number of nights spent in hospital for neurological reasons. Conclusions: The IPES is an accurate, acceptable, and quick measurement tool that reflects the way in which childhood epilepsy has an impact on the child and on family life. It may be helpful in routine clinical care and may be useful in the research setting to find ways to improve the lives of children with epilepsy.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

The association of childhood sexual intercourse, excluding sexual abuse, with adolescent health and risk behaviors was examined using the urban component of a statewide study on adolescent health, risky behaviors, and resiliency factors. Methodology. A specialized cohort design was used to derive a two-group sample. Index cases consisted of all adolescents who indicated that they had first intercourse at or before age 10 years, and controls were adolescents who either had not yet had intercourse or had done so at age 16 years or older. To avoid confounding with issues of sexual abuse, all adolescents who also indicated a history of sexual abuse on the survey were removed from the analysis, so that the comparison could focus on health and behavioral correlates of respondents who did not define their childhood sexual intercourse as constituting abuse. Comparisons were conducted separately for girls and boys. Results. A significantly greater proportion of index cases than controls indicated problem substance use by parents, poor school performance, gang involvement, frequent and unprotected sexual intercourse, history of pregnancy involvement, desire to leave the home, history of mental health treatment, emotional distress, and suicidal involvement. Logistic regression revealed significant group differences including academic risk, gang involvement, frequency of sexual intercourse, and history of mental health treatment. Correct group classification with the logit model was approximately 90% for both girls and boys. Conclusions. The results underscore the importance of childhood sexual intercourse as an indicator of other health-compromising behaviors and risk factors. Clinicians should be alert to this clustering of risk behaviors in their psychosocial assessment of young people.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

There is sufficient scientific evidence that noise exposure can induce hearing impairment, hypertension and ischemic heart disease, annoyance, sleep disturbance, and decreased school performance. For other effects such as changes in the immune system and birth defects, the evidence is limited. Most public health impacts of noise were already identified in the 1960s and noise abatement is less of a scientific but primarily a policy problem. A subject for further research is the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying noise-induced cardiovascular disorders and the relationship of noise with annoyance and nonacoustical factors modifying health outcomes. A high priority study subject is the effects of noise on children, including cognitive effects and their reversibility. Noise exposure is on the increase, especially in the general living environment, both in industrialized nations and in developing world regions.

Anonymous surveys were conducted in 10th- and 12th-grade students' classrooms in 1995. The following effects were associated with long hours of weekly employment during the school year: (1) decreased performance/engagement in school and satisfaction with amount of leisure time, and (2) increased health risk behaviors and psychological stress. The effects of school-year work on academic factors and health behaviors differed by grade, but not by race/ethnicity, parent education, or race/ethnicity and parent education considered together. It was concluded that parents and professionals should continue to monitor the number of weekly hours that students work during the school year.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

A questionnaire was completed and acne graded by the Global Acne Grading scale. Psychological morbidity and quality of life (QOL) were assessed by the General Health Questionnaire and Dermatology Specific Quality of Life Questionnaires, respectively. We found that clinical severity was not associated with patient perception or psychological distress. The QOL measures such as feelings, social activities, performance at work or school, activities of daily living and overall mental health were found to be associated with distress with associated P-values of 0.0002, 0.0168, 0.0032, 0.033 and < 0.0001, respectively. The severity of acne was not associated with psychological distress. Painful and bleeding lesions were associated with distress levels: P = 0.042 and P = 0.019, respectively.

These stressful events and thier consequences on the quality of life and academic success are particularly significant among low-income and ethnic minority students in American society. Many schools have adopted strategies to help students who are impacted by stressful life events to deal affectively with their problems in an attempt to reduce school failure and school dropout rates among these students. Most notable among these strategies are school-based mental health programs including the establishment of school-based mental health teams which seek to proactively address individual student concerns while improving the general climate of schools. The evidence seems to support the claim that these school-based services have a positive impact on students' social and emotional well-being as well as on their academic achievements. However, with more careful monitoring and much more consistent support from administrators and policy makers, these school-based approaches can more fully realize their potential to enhance the quality of life and to positively impact the future of many poor and ethnic minority students. © 2002 by The Haworth Press.

In New Orleans, the Violence Intervention Program for Children and Families is designed to reduce the risk of exposure to violence, mental health problems following exposure, interference with normal developmental progression, academic performance, family functioning, onset of behavioral and conduct disturbances, later psychopathology, and subsequent violence. The program includes an unusual focus on work with police officers as first responders to increase their sensitivity and responsiveness to traumatized children. A psychoanalytic perspective helps a therapist or interventionist understand a person's strengths and weaknesses, frustrations, and conflicts as well as those within a chaotic environment and social situation. The psychoanalytic approach allows for more effective therapeutic approaches as well as more flexible problem-solving strategies.","Review","Final","","Scopus"

All dental undergraduates attending a UK dental school were invited to complete a questionnaire on age, gender, year of study, EI, and PS. Two hundred and thirteen students (48 percent male) participated, a response rate of 70 percent. The mean score for EI was 117.54 (S.D. 14.90) and PS was 17.73 (S.D. 6.49). Factor analysis confirmed four factors previously identified in the literature as comprising emotional intelligence: optimism/mood regulation, utilization of emotions, appraisal of emotions, and social skills. T-tests indicated that females had significantly higher EI scores than males. Mean PS scores were significantly higher for students aged over twenty-one years compared with those aged twenty-one years or less (p < 0.001), female compared to male students (p < 0.05), and those in higher years compared to those in lower years of study (p < 0.001). Correlational analysis showed an inverse relationship between EI and PS. Multiple regression analysis identified year of study, optimism/mood regulation, and gender as independent, significant predictors of PS. In conclusion, low EI scorers report more PS. Future research should investigate the relationships of EI and PS with impact on lifestyle behaviors, academic and clinical performance, and health outcomes.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

More boys were affected than girls, and 90% of those with enuresis were aged 6-11 years. Presence of enuresis was found to be associated with psychosocial stress in the family; large family size; a positive family history, poorer scholastic performance and presence of psychiatric disturbance as indicated by the Rutter parent score.

Methodology/Study design: A cross sectional study using a semi-structured self administered questionnaire was carried out over four weeks, using a small sample of students of all categories and classes of a medical college. Results: A total of 264 students out of 300 (88%) filled in the questionnaire. Inability to cope, helplessness, increased psychological pressure, mental tension and too much workload are 'stress factors' for students. A considerable majority (> 90%) think that they have been stressed at one time or another. Ninety-four per cent of males have experienced stress. The senior students of the fourth and final year feel more stressed (95% and 98% respectively). Low moods, inability to concentrate, loss of temper are most common symptoms. Females report more symptoms. Academics and exams are the most powerful stressors. Sports, music, hanging out with friends, sleeping or going into isolation are various coping mechanisms. Stress can affect the academic performance. If needed, students prefer to talk to a peer. They demand more recreational activities on campus, revised schedule of academics and exams, better counselling facilities and improvement in student-teacher relationship. Conclusion: The prevalence of perceived stress seems to be high among medical students, which tends to affect not only their academic performances but also all aspects of health. Review of academics and exam schedules, more leisure time activities, better interaction with the faculty and proper guidance, advisory services and peer counselling at the campus could do a lot to reduce the stress. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Using data from the National Survey of Black Americans (NSBA), we find that measures of body image, role performance, discrimination, and social class position are related to mental health status. Women of lower social class standing are especially at risk for poor mental health outcomes. Having low educational attainment, low personal incomes, and less prestigious occupations is associated with a poor self-concept (self-esteem and self-efficacy). Women with low self-concepts, in turn, report poorer mental health.

At the same time, research from across the globe reports an alarming increase in the occupational stress experienced by university staff. We report on the first phase of a longitudinal investigation of occupational stress. A total of 22 focus groups were conducted with a representative sample of 178 academic and general staff from 15 Australian universities. The groups focused on understanding staff's experience of occupational stress, and perceptions of the sources, consequences and moderators of stress. Both general and academic staff reported a dramatic increase in stress during the previous 5 years. As a group, academic staff reported higher levels of stress than general staff. Five major sources of stress were identified including: insufficient funding and resources; work overload; poor management practice; job insecurity; and insufficient recognition and reward. The majority of groups reported that job-related stress was having a deleterious impact on their professional work and personal welfare.

According to this image, competence and personality do count. Scarcely anyone doubts that equal opportunities exist for women in a job traditionally dominated by men. If this self-portrait is correct, the workload should not result in a higher level of strain or incidence of illness. To clarify this problem all members of the Hamburgische Architektenkammer (Professional Association of Architects) were surveyed in 1999, and the results compared with those of a reference academic group. 25% of questionnaires were returned (males 24 %, females 30%). 29% of female full-time architects were married, only 13% had children (47% and 39% respectively in the comparative group). Psychotherapeutic treatment was at 16 % significantly more frequent among female architects than among male architects or females of a reference group (6% and 7% respectively; p < 0. 01 each). Via logistic regression, only the job could be established as an influencing factor. Female architects demonstrated a significantly higher points score on the Maslach burnout inventory than their male colleagues (15.6 vs. 13.5). Neither the double burden caused by bringing up children, nor age, was seen to have a negative influence on the stress parameters investigated. In contrast to the self-portrait of female architects, the job of architects characterised by the terms pressure to achieve maximum performance, competition and struggle"" (Eichstddt-Bohlig, 2000) which obviously requires a ""male orientation "" seems to have a negative effect on the mental health of a proportion of female architects. Female qualifications such as a more communicative work style should therefore be more deeply considered in the recruitment of female architects. These qualifications should be used more consciously by companies, even and particularly when middle-aged women after the upbringing of children show an increasing tendency to return to work, especially since the double burden of parenthood does not have a negative health effect.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

As a second stage, we designed a stress management pilot programme (SMPP) including psychoeducational resources; coping skills training; deep breathing, relaxation and guided imaginary techniques; cognitive restructuring and time management. To evaluate the effects of the SMPP on students we assessed a set of variables before and after the treatment: Anxiety, anger, stress, coping strategies, helplessness, salivary cortisol and psycho-physiological reactivity levels. Towards the end of their SMPP exposure, students had lower levels of stress, anxiety, anger, neuroticism, helplessness and salivary cortisol.

Methods: Data was taken from the first, cross-sectional phase of the VISAT study (aging, health, and work), which took place in 1996. Participants were randomly drawn from the patient lists of about one hundred occupational physicians in three regions of southern France. The current study concerned 2,768 wage earners born in 1944, 1954, or 1964. The material consisted of 59 questions aimed at assessing a broad set of working conditions, some of which were proxy measures of the dimensions described in the Karasek and Siegrist models. Results: From a principal component analysis, three main factors were extracted that accounted for 40% of the total variance. The first factor (α = 0.79) included items that referred to the decision latitude in the Karasek model and items that referred to the reward dimension in the Siegrist model. The second factor (α = 0.77) was made up of items tapping physical stressors, while the third factor (α = 0.71) pooled items that corresponded fairly well to psychological demands in the Karasek model. Highly significant relationships (p < 10-4) were found between the mean factor scores and both occupational status and educational level, with a lower occupational status and educational level being associated with greater lack of job control and rewards, higher physical stress, but lower psychological demands. Less job control and fewer rewards were also found to be greater in older workers (p < 10 -3) and females (p < 10-4). Conclusion: Our results thus confirm the existence of a strong association, in a French cohort, between occupational status and dimensions of job stress known to be associated with adverse health outcomes.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The spatial and temporal variability of noise levels makes their precise assessment in these studies fairly difficult. Furthermore, standardized measurement methods are not available for some health indicators, especially mental health indicators, so that comparing and combining results from different studies for meta-analysis purposes is complex. Moreover, confounding factors, such as socioeconomic variables, can affect the relation between noise exposure and health but are not always taken into account in epidemiological studies.

Study design: Children 4 to 15 years of age who complained frequently of aches and pains to parents were compared with those with infrequent or no pain on measures of demographics, psychopathology, school attendance and performance, perceived health, and service use. Univariate analysis was followed by logistic regression. Results: Children who complained often of aches and pains used more health services, had more psychosocial problems, missed more school, and did worse academically. After controlling for health service use and demographics, recurrent pain was significantly associated with negative parental perceptions of child health and the presence of internalizing psychiatric symptoms. Higher levels of ambulatory health service use were associated with negative perceptions of child health, recurrent pain, visits for ""unexplained"" symptoms, and internalizing psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Pediatric recurrent pain challenges traditional service delivery models characterized by segregated systems of care for physical and mental disorders. Longitudinal and psychobiological studies of the relationship between recurrent pain, internalizing psychopathology, and health beliefs are warranted to direct future treatment efforts.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Medical school is recognized as a stressful environment that often exerts a negative effect on the academic performance, physical health, and psychological well-being of the student. Method. Stress, coping, depression, and somatic distress were examined among 69 third-year students completing a psychiatry clerkship in 1992-93 at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. Stress was assessed using the Medical Education Hassles Scale-R. Coping was assessed using the Coping Strategies Inventory. Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, and somatic distress was assessed using the Wahler Physical Symptoms Inventory. Statistical methods included correlational analysis and hierarchical regression. Results. Clinical levels of depression were found in 16 (23%) of the students, and 39 (57%) endorsed high levels of somatic distress. Stress accounted for a large percentage of the distress variance (i.e., 29% to 50%). Coping efforts contributed significant variance to the prediction of distress above and beyond that accounted for by stress alone, especially in relation to depression. Coping efforts classified by Engagement strategies were associated with fewer depressive symptoms, while coping efforts classified by Disengagement strategies were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Conclusions. Because students who employed coping efforts characterized by Engagement strategics suffered from fewer depressive symptoms, the results suggest that training in these types of strategies may be a useful intervention to lessen the negative consequences of stress among medical students. © 1994 Association of American Medical Colleges.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Method: Faculty and staff employed by a large American university medical centre completed a questionnaire package including several measures designed to assess specific attitudes toward medical students with emotional problems. Data were also collected on the degree to which specific mental disorders were thought to interfere with the performance of medical students. Results: In general, prior experience with mental illness, either through personal or professional activities, was associated with more positive attitudes about students with mental illness.

The school as institution and the teachers as empowered mediators offer the appropriate conditions for implementing an effective large-scale intervention program. Well-intentioned child professionals who deal with school administrators and teachers must take into account that, as stated by Pfefferbaum et al [25], ""avoidance is at the core of the posttraumatic response, and it sometimes involves avoidance of treatment."" For child mental health professionals, routine collaboration across systemic boundaries may prove critical for the rapid mobilization of resources during mass traumatic emergencies.

Compared with nonvulnerable caregivers, vulnerable caregivers were more likely to have difficulty providing care, to provide higher-intensity care, to report that their physical health had suffered since becoming a caregiver, to be aged 65 years or older, to be married, and to have less than 12 years of education. Conclusions. Reliance on informal caregivers without considering the caregiver's ability to provide care can create a stressful and potentially unsafe environment for the caregiver and the care recipient.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This report describes a controlled trial of emotional disclosure, adapted for school children, with the major hypothesis that the repeated description of negative events will have beneficial effects on measures of mental health, attendance, and school performance. The sample consisted of children aged 8-13 years from four schools, a primary and a secondary school both from a suburban and an inner-city area. Children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: writing about negative events, writing about nonemotional events, and a non-writing control group. Children in all groups were seen four times during a single week and were then followed up after 2 months with measures of health and school performance. The intervention was well received by both schools and children, and the scripts written by the emotional and nonemotional writing groups differed in content in the predicted ways. Contrary to expectation, there was little evidence of a specific effect of emotional disclosure, and several possible reasons for this are discussed. Nevertheless, there was a general reduction in symptom measures, indicating that children may have benefited from their involvement in the study. Although there are several possible explanations for our findings, they indicate that it is both feasible and potentially valuable to give children opportunities to engage in discussion about sources of stress and their reactions to them.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Intensive neurobehavioral and biochemical investigations eventually led to the diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC), an autosomal recessively inherited storage disease that is associated with the accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes and difficulties in the processing of exogenously derived cholesterol. Clues to the presence of a neurological disorder included: a history of insidiously declining academic and athletic performance which antedated the onset of psychosis; abnormalities on mental status examination, including psychomotor slowing, memory difficulties, and impairment of higher attentional functions; physical findings of subtle downgaze impairment, mild symmetrical hyperreflexia, and lower-extremity hypertonia with flexor plantar responses, marked impairment of upper-extremity rapid alternating movements, action tremor, and bilateral posturing with stress gait maneuvers. This case demonstrates the importance of careful and persistent neurodiagnostic evaluation in adolescents with psychotic presentations, particularly when cognitive and motor deterioration is suspected, and even when head CT and MRI scans are judged to be normal.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Furthermore, competitive women were more likely than noncompetitive women to have mental and physical health problems, but there was no such difference for males. In general, masculinity emerged as a beneficial constellation of traits for both males and females, correlating negatively with achievement conflicts and stress symptoms, and positively with mastery and work. Femininity, on the other hand, appeared to be a detrimental cluster of traits for both sexes, at least in terms of academic performance and health. Implications for the controversial concept of androgyny were discussed, and it was suggested that, in the future, research inspired by an ideal conception of adult behavior confront the ideal directly rather than describe it in terms of the traditional concepts of masculinity and femininity. Any such research effort will have to deal with the pivotal role of competitiveness. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved","Article","Final","","Scopus"
